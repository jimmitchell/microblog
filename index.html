			 <p>Change is inevitable in today&rsquo;s world as technology advances, industries evolve, and societies progress. The idea of &ldquo;better means different&rdquo; has gained popularity, suggesting that to improve, one must embrace change and pursue new and unconventional approaches.

			 <p>Are you feeling overwhelmed by life? Do you find yourself juggling multiple tasks, drowning in notifications, and feeling like there&rsquo;s never enough time in a day? If so, you&rsquo;re not alone. In today&rsquo;s fast-paced world, simplicity has become a luxury that many of us crave. The good news is that living a more simple life is totally achievable, and it can bring you a sense of peace, contentment, and fulfillment.</p>
<p>To help you simplify your life, here are some practical tips I&rsquo;ve found are easy to fold into your daily routine:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Simplicity looks different for everyone. It&rsquo;s not about following a rigid set of rules or standards, but rather about finding what works best for you and your lifestyle. Embrace the process of simplifying your life at your own pace, and don&rsquo;t be afraid to make adjustments along the way.</p>
<p>Living a more simple life isn&rsquo;t about depriving yourself of things, but rather about creating space for what truly matters to you. It&rsquo;s about living intentionally, with a focus on the present moment and the things that bring you joy and fulfillment. So, take a step back, look at your priorities, and take one simple step to start simplifying your life today. You might be surprised at how much more fulfilling and meaningful life can be when you embrace the beauty of simplicity.</p>
<p>Are you ready to simplify your life? Start by decluttering a physical space, prioritizing your time and energy, or being present in the moment. Reflect on your values and priorities, and make conscious choices that align with them. Embrace the beauty of nature, cultivate meaningful relationships, and practice gratitude.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a journey, not a destination. Be patient with yourself and enjoy the process.</p>

		<a href="https://jimmitchell.org/2023/04/28/personal-blogging-vs.html" class="u-url"><time class="dt-published" datetime="2023-04-28 10:32:28 -1000">Apr 28, 2023</time></a>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>The world of social media transformed the way we interact and share content online. Platforms like Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter gave us quick and easy ways to share our thoughts, images, and videos with the world. But what about personal blogging? Is there still a place for it in today&rsquo;s digital age?</p>
<p>Personal blogging first became popular in the early 2000s, with platforms like Blogger, LiveJournal, and WordPress. These platforms gave people a space to express themselves, share their stories, and connect with like-minded individuals. However, with the rise of social media, personal blogging began to lose its appeal. Social media offered more convenience, instant gratification, and the ability to connect with others easily.</p>
<p>But in recent years, personal blogging has made a comeback. Why? Because personal blogging offers something that social media platforms don&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>First, personal blogging gives you complete control over your content. Unlike social media, where algorithms decide which posts to show and which to hide, personal blogs give you the power to create a unique brand and present yourself in the way you choose.</p>
<p>Second, personal blogging allows for longer-form content. On social media, posts are limited in length and can be easily overlooked by users scrolling through their feeds. Personal blogs provide a space for more in-depth writing, which can attract readers who are looking for more than just a quick update.</p>
<p>Finally, personal blogs can provide significant benefits for businesses. By maintaining a blog, businesses can improve their search engine optimization (SEO), build a loyal audience, and increase their credibility in their field.</p>
<p>So why is personal blogging better than closed-wall social media? For one, personal blogs offer freedom of expression. On social media, content that goes against platform policies can be removed without warning. Personal bloggers can express their opinions and beliefs without the fear of censorship.</p>
<p>Second, personal blogs are less algorithmic. Social media platforms use algorithms to determine which content users see. This means that even if a post is excellent, it may not be seen by a large audience. Personal blogs, on the other hand, allow for more organic discovery of content.</p>
<p>Finally, personal blogs are more authentic. Social media platforms have become a breeding ground for fake accounts and paid promotions. Personal blogs provide a space for genuine expression and real connections.</p>
<p>To sum it up, personal blogging still has a place in today&rsquo;s digital age. While social media has its benefits, personal blogging provides a space for more control, creativity, and authenticity. Whether you&rsquo;re blogging for personal expression or business benefits, there&rsquo;s no denying the unique advantages that personal blogging offers.</p>

			<h1><a href="https://jimmitchell.org/2023/04/18/minimalism-vs-essentialism.html">Minimalism vs. Essentialism: Understanding the Difference and How It Impacts Your Life</a></h1>
		

		<a href="https://jimmitchell.org/2023/04/18/minimalism-vs-essentialism.html" class="u-url"><time class="dt-published" datetime="2023-04-18 06:28:09 -1000">Apr 18, 2023</time></a>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>In today&rsquo;s fast-paced and consumer-driven world, many people are seeking ways to simplify their lives and focus on what truly matters. Two popular concepts that often come up in these discussions are minimalism and essentialism. While they may seem similar on the surface, they are distinct ideologies with different approaches to living intentionally. In this blog post, we will delve into the differences between minimalism and essentialism and explore how each of them can impact your life in unique ways.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Minimalism is a lifestyle and design movement that advocates for simplicity and the idea that less is more. It encourages the removal of unnecessary possessions, distractions, and clutter from your life, with the goal of creating more space, time, and freedom for what truly matters. Minimalism is often associated with a minimalist aesthetic, characterized by clean lines, neutral colors, and a focus on functionality.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Essentialism, on the other hand, is a philosophical concept that emphasizes the pursuit of what truly matters and the intentional allocation of resources, such as time, energy, and attention. Essentialism encourages focusing on the essential few and eliminating the non-essential many, in order to make meaningful contributions and live a purpose-driven life. Essentialism is about discerning what truly matters to you and aligning your choices with your values and purpose.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>While minimalism and essentialism share some similarities, they have distinct differences in their principles and approaches. Here are some key differences:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Minimalism can have a positive impact on your life in various ways:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Essentialism can also have a significant impact on your life:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>In a nutshell, minimalism and essentialism may seem similar, but they have distinct differences in their principles and approaches. Minimalism focuses on decluttering possessions and simplifying external spaces, while essentialism emphasizes discernment, alignment with values and purpose, and intentional allocation of resources. Both can have a positive impact on your life, such as reduced clutter, increased mindfulness, enhanced aesthetics, clarity, focus, alignment with values and purpose, and better decision-making.</p>
<p>Incorporating elements of both minimalism and essentialism into your life can be a powerful combination. By decluttering your physical space and being intentional about what truly matters to you, you can create a more focused and meaningful life. Aligning your choices with your values and purpose can help you live a more intentional and purpose-driven life.</p>
<p>Whether you choose to embrace minimalism and simplify your possessions or practice essentialism to align your choices with your values and purpose, it&rsquo;s about finding what works best for you. It&rsquo;s not about strict rules or ideologies, but rather about creating a life that aligns with your true values and purpose. Embrace the journey of self-discovery and intentional living, and see how minimalism and essentialism can positively impact your life in unique and meaningful ways.</p>
<p>So, go ahead and declutter your physical space, be intentional about what you allow into your life, and align your choices with your values and purpose. Embrace the minimalist mindset of &ldquo;less is more&rdquo; and the essentialist philosophy of pursuing what truly matters. Create a life that is focused, intentional, and meaningful - a life that is uniquely yours!</p>

			 <p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->This post is written based on my own struggles as someone diagnosed with Meniere&rsquo;s Disease. It took years to get a proper diagnosis because the condition is so rare.<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>As someone who has been living with Meniere&rsquo;s Disease for more than a decade, I know firsthand the challenges and impact it can have on daily life. Meniere&rsquo;s Disease is a chronic vestibular disorder that affects the inner ear, leading to episodes of vertigo, tinnitus, hearing loss, and a feeling of fullness or pressure in the ear. These episodes can be unpredictable and disabling, making it difficult to carry out routine activities and affecting overall quality of life.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>One of the most distressing symptoms of Meniere&rsquo;s Disease for me is vertigo. During a vertigo attack, I feel a spinning sensation, accompanied by severe dizziness, imbalance, and nausea &ndash; often with vomiting. The attacks can last for hours or even days, leaving me feeling exhausted and disoriented. The hearing loss and tinnitus that accompany Meniere&rsquo;s Disease also add to the challenges. The hearing loss can range from mild to severe and may be temporary or permanent. The tinnitus, which is a constant ringing, buzzing, or roaring in the ear, can be bothersome and impact my concentration and sleep.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Living with Meniere&rsquo;s Disease can be emotionally and physically draining. The unpredictability of vertigo attacks and the impact on daily activities can lead to frustration, anxiety, and depression. The hearing loss and tinnitus can also affect communication and social interactions, leading to feelings of isolation and withdrawal. Additionally, the fear of having a vertigo attack in public or at work can create challenges in managing work responsibilities and engaging in social activities.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Over the years, I have learned to develop strategies to cope with Meniere&rsquo;s Disease and manage its impact on my daily life. Here are some strategies that have helped me:</p>

<p>By using strategies such as lifestyle adjustments, stress management, it is possible to manage the symptoms and improve overall quality of life. If you suspect that you or a loved one may have Meniere&rsquo;s Disease, it is important to seek medical evaluation and guidance for proper diagnosis and management. Remember that you are not alone, and there are resources available to help you cope with Meniere&rsquo;s Disease.</p>

			 <p>In our busy lives, it&rsquo;s easy to let things pile up and overcommit ourselves, all under the guise of importance. We may find ourselves saying yes to tasks or commitments that we should have said no to, driven by our ego or fear of disappointing others. But it&rsquo;s crucial to recognize when we&rsquo;re stretching ourselves too thin and take steps to lighten the load. Here are some strategies to help you learn to say no and guard your relationships and health.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>When faced with a new commitment, take a moment to consider who will be affected the most. It&rsquo;s easy to neglect important relationships, such as family, when we&rsquo;re overwhelmed with other responsibilities. Reflect on the impact your commitments are having on your loved ones and your own well-being. Remember that nurturing these relationships should be a priority, and it&rsquo;s okay to say no to other commitments to protect them.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Let go of your ego and acknowledge that you&rsquo;re not the only person who can handle a particular task or commitment. There may be others who are equally or even more qualified to take it on. Consider delegating or sharing the workload with someone else. It&rsquo;s also okay to allow others to be challenged and grow by taking on tasks that may be outside their comfort zone.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Question the importance of the commitment. Sometimes, we assume that a task is crucial to others when in reality, it may not be as important as we think. Talk to the person who asked for your help and clarify their expectations. They may have alternative solutions or be willing to find someone else to take over. Open communication can prevent misunderstandings and unnecessary burdens.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Saying no may not always be easy, and it may result in disappointment or hurt feelings. However, it&rsquo;s crucial to prioritize your well-being and be honest with others about your limitations. Share how the commitments are affecting your life and relationships in a respectful and compassionate manner. Most people will understand and appreciate your honesty. However, some may not, and that&rsquo;s okay. Hold your ground and stay true to your decision, knowing that it&rsquo;s the best choice for you.</p>
<p>Learning to say no and lighten your load is a process that requires self-awareness and assertiveness. It&rsquo;s important to guard your relationships and health closely and make intentional choices about your commitments. Remember, saying no doesn&rsquo;t make you less capable or caring; it&rsquo;s a sign of self-care and healthy boundaries. So, reflect on your commitments, be willing to delegate or say no when needed, and learn to listen to your heart instead of your ego. Your well-being and relationships will thank you in the end.</p>

			<h1><a href="https://jimmitchell.org/2019/11/09/its-your-first.html">It&#39;s Your First Dreamforce. What Should You Expect?</a></h1>
		

		<a href="https://jimmitchell.org/2019/11/09/its-your-first.html" class="u-url"><time class="dt-published" datetime="2019-11-09 10:20:44 -1000">Nov 9, 2019</time></a>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>Exciting! It&rsquo;s your very first Dreamforce!</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re eagerly anticipating being part of the magic. I bet you&rsquo;ve already checked out other blogs to prepare for this moment. Well, here are some recommendations from me to make your Dreamforce experience even more memorable.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Make sure to wear shoes that your feet are already used to and comfortable in. Don&rsquo;t buy new shoes to wear for the first time at Dreamforce. You may even want to bring two pairs of super-comfy shoes if possible. Trust me, your feet will thank you. Walking is a big part of Dreamforce (I logged over 40 miles last year!), and by the end of the first day, your feet will be tired. Having an extra pair of shoes can help reduce foot fatigue and keep you feeling refreshed.</p>
<p>Also, bring extra socks and change them during the day. It&rsquo;ll make a difference, I promise.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Rumor has it that Salesforce reduced the number of attendees this year compared to last, but still, be prepared for crowds and chaos. The entire Dreamforce campus will be packed, with most people looking at their mobile devices to figure out where to go next. So, pack your patience along with those comfy shoes.</p>
<p>Some people will be friendly, and some won&rsquo;t. That&rsquo;s just how it is. But deciding to be friendly and approachable will go a long way in enjoying the whole experience.</p>
<p>Remember to smile at others and strike up a conversation with a stranger or two while waiting in line. You never know who you might meet by chance.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>During my first year at Dreamforce, I filled my schedule with back-to-back sessions I wanted to attend, but I barely made it to half of them. Give yourself plenty of time to get to your next session. Keep in mind the crowds, chaos, and pandemonium, not just on the streets but also in the hotels where sessions are held.</p>
<p>Twenty minutes to get from one place to another is not enough unless the sessions are in the same hotel. Give yourself enough time to get there and find a good seat.</p>
<p>Also, leave some empty time in your schedule to wander around areas you&rsquo;re interested in. The Admin, Developer, or Expo halls have a lot to see. Having some free time to stroll through them might lead to unexpected opportunities to learn something new or meet someone interesting.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>It&rsquo;s easy to skip meals or forget to drink water at Dreamforce. Bring high-protein or complex carb, non-sugary snacks to keep hunger at bay. It&rsquo;ll help you retain the patience you&rsquo;ll need throughout the event.</p>
<p>Staying hydrated will also reduce headaches and fatigue. There will be water stations all over the place, so make sure to use them!</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Unless you absolutely need to have your laptop with you, leave it at the hotel. I carried mine during my first Dreamforce and only used it once. It ended up being more of a burden than a tool.</p>
<p>Instead, carry an analog journal to take notes, or have a good note-taking app on your phone. Our team will be using Quip to share session notes with each other this year. The app is so good that it has a permanent place on my phone&rsquo;s home screen.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>If you happen to come across someone from the Salesforce community who inspires you, take the opportunity to introduce yourself to them. Be polite and respectful of any ongoing conversations they may be in, but by introducing yourself, you could open the door to a friendship or future opportunities.</p>
<p>The community heroes are heroes for a reason - they enjoy sharing their knowledge and experiences with others. So don&rsquo;t be shy, strike up a conversation and make connections. You might just end up with a mentor or a new friend.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Dreamforce can be overwhelming with its non-stop activities, sessions, and events. It&rsquo;s important to take breaks and pace yourself to avoid burnout. Find a quiet corner or a park within the Dreamforce campus to take a breather and relax.</p>
<p>You can also take advantage of the Dreamforce App to plan your schedule and set reminders for breaks. Don&rsquo;t push yourself too hard trying to do everything. Remember, quality over quantity.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>The Dreamforce Expo Hall is massive, with hundreds of vendors showcasing their products and services. Take the time to explore and engage with the vendors that align with your interests or business needs.</p>
<p>Be sure to have your badge scanned at vendor booths for a chance to win prizes and giveaways. It&rsquo;s also an excellent opportunity to learn about new Salesforce technologies and solutions that can benefit your organization.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Sometimes, the sessions you want to attend might be full, or the lines might be too long. Always have a backup plan. Identify alternative sessions or activities in case your first choice doesn&rsquo;t work out.</p>
<p>You can also check out the Dreamforce recordings after the event to catch up on sessions you missed. And don&rsquo;t forget to engage on social media using hashtags to join the conversation and stay updated on the latest happenings.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Dreamforce is not just about learning and networking; it&rsquo;s also about having fun and enjoying the experience. Take advantage of the numerous parties, concerts, and special events happening throughout the week.</p>
<p>Attend the Dreamfest concert, participate in the 5K run, or simply hang out at the various lounges and relaxation areas. Make the most of your time at Dreamforce by immersing yourself in the unique atmosphere and energy of the event.</p>
<p>In conclusion, your first Dreamforce can be an overwhelming but exciting experience. Be prepared for crowds, stay hydrated and well-fed, plan your schedule wisely, and don&rsquo;t forget to have fun. Embrace the opportunity to learn, network, and connect with fellow Salesforce enthusiasts. Make memories that will last a lifetime, and most importantly, enjoy the journey!</p>

			 <p>One of my earliest childhood memories still haunts me to this day. I was just a three-and-a-half-year-old boy living with my mother, stepfather, and newborn sister in an old house in the middle of the desert in Lancaster, California. My mother was preoccupied with taking care of my baby sister, so I was often left to my own devices.</p>
<p>One day, I stumbled upon an ant mound in the open area behind our house. Intrigued, I decided to befriend the ants by sitting down next to their mound. Little did I know, these were not your ordinary ants - they were large, red and black ones with powerful jaws. As soon as I sat down, the ants swarmed me, biting me all over my body.</p>
<p>The pain was excruciating, and I panicked. I tried to brush the ants off, but they kept coming. In a frenzy, I stripped off my clothes and ran naked towards the house, screaming for my mother. When I burst into the room where she was nursing my sister, she was shocked to see her little boy covered in red welts, crying uncontrollably.</p>
<p>My mother quickly tended to my wounds, squishing the remaining ants in my hair and applying ointment to soothe the bites. Her care helped calm me down, but the experience left a lasting impression on me. My mother found the whole ordeal hilarious, but for me, it was a traumatic lesson learned.</p>
<p>Since that day, I&rsquo;ve developed a fear of ants. Even the smallest ones make me jittery, and I can&rsquo;t shake off the feeling of panic when I see them crawling on me. I&rsquo;ve never sat on an ant mound again, knowing the consequences all too well. My mother and I reminisced about that incident many times over the years, and it&rsquo;s a memory that still lingers with me, half a century later.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>Almost fifty years have passed, and I can still vividly recall the first time I lit a cigarette. I was just a seven-year-old boy, living on a farm in rural Colorado with my mother, step-father (if you could call him that), and half-sister. There were no kids my age nearby to play with, so I often found myself engaging in activities that little boys should not be doing. I had stolen a pack of my mother&rsquo;s Kool Menthol 100s and a pack of matches, and I thought I could smoke just like the adults in my life.</p>
<p>I sneaked outside and hid behind the juniper trees, feeling a sense of rebellion and curiosity. I opened the pack, took out one of the long cigarettes, put it between my lips, struck a match, and lit up, taking a puff just like I had seen the grown-ups do. To my surprise, I didn&rsquo;t find the taste repulsive. In fact, I kind of liked it. I remember the sensation of menthol on my tongue, the slight burn in my throat, and feeling strangely grown up.</p>
<p>As I grew older, I experimented with smoking occasionally, but it never really stuck. I would smoke here and there but would eventually lose interest. That changed when I met Tracy, a boy my age who had just moved into the neighborhood. He was already a pack-a-day smoker, and one summer evening, he offered me a Marlboro Red from his hard pack box, explaining that soft packs were not cool. I started taking him up on his offers and before I knew it, I was smoking every day, even bumming cigarettes from friends whenever I could.</p>
<p>Then came the moment I realized I was hooked: I wanted to smoke even when I was alone. My mother, in her unique parenting style, decided to buy cigarettes for me openly rather than have me hide my habit. She hoped I would come to hate smoking and quit, but that didn&rsquo;t quite go as planned. By the time I was sixteen, I was a confirmed pack-a-day smoker. It wasn&rsquo;t about being cool like other kids; it was about feeding my nicotine addiction. Twelve years passed in a blur of cigarettes, until I met Pam.</p>
<p>I remember our first date like it was yesterday. We were running across a busy street in Santa Monica, heading to a club to see a band. In the middle of the street, my hard pack of Marlboro Lights fell from my shirt pocket with a loud thud. I quickly picked them up, but when we reached the sidewalk, Pam told me, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t date people who smoke.&rdquo; It felt like a punch to the face, but it was a wake-up call I needed.</p>
<p>From that moment on, I didn&rsquo;t light up on any of our dates or any day after that. Pam became my best friend, and we&rsquo;ve been married for 25 years now. I made the choice to quit smoking because of her, and I&rsquo;m proud to say that I haven&rsquo;t touched a cigarette since before we were engaged. I remember many cigarettes I smoked throughout my life, but thanks to someone special, I can&rsquo;t recall the very last one. And for that, I&rsquo;m eternally grateful.</p>

			 <p>Do you ever find yourself using up every excuse in the book to avoid doing something you&rsquo;ve been putting off? I know I do. I&rsquo;ve been running this blog for nearly 14 years, yet I only have 11 posts to show for it. That&rsquo;s less than one post per year, and the newest one is over a year old. I used to write more frequently, but like many artists, I ended up trashing most of my work because I felt like it wasn&rsquo;t good enough. Looking back, I regret that decision.</p>
<p>Writing has always been a passion of mine. I love the process of putting words down, then rearranging them to communicate my ideas. When I&rsquo;m in the flow, the words just come out effortlessly, and I feel like I&rsquo;ve created something that has a life of its own.</p>
<p>However, a few years back, I made a fatal mistake. I started modeling my writing after what other people were doing, trying to find my own voice. But because it wasn&rsquo;t truly my voice, I began to doubt the value of what I had to say. This led to a severe case of writer&rsquo;s block that lasted for years. It was painful to even think about writing, and I only managed to publish three posts in 2018, and they were a struggle.</p>
<p>To fill the void of creativity, I found myself procrastinating by endlessly tweaking my WordPress theme. I became obsessed with making it pixel perfect and starting over from scratch multiple times. I&rsquo;ve written and tweaked more CSS code than I care to admit, and my site theme is now practically everything I&rsquo;ve ever imagined in my head. There&rsquo;s not much more room for improvement, if any.</p>
<p>So, what do I do now?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve realized that it&rsquo;s time to stop procrastinating and just write. It doesn&rsquo;t have to be perfect, and my writing will improve with practice. It doesn&rsquo;t have to be profound or impart deep wisdom to the reader. I simply need to start getting the thoughts in my head onto the page.</p>
<p>The best place to start is here and now, so I&rsquo;ve decided to begin again.</p>
<p>What about you? What have you been putting off? Is now the time for you to start afresh too? Remember, perfection isn&rsquo;t necessary, just taking that first step towards your goal can make all the difference.</p>

			<h1><a href="https://jimmitchell.org/2017/04/13/dealing-with-digital.html">Dealing with Digital Distractions: How I Regained Control of My Life</a></h1>
		

		<a href="https://jimmitchell.org/2017/04/13/dealing-with-digital.html" class="u-url"><time class="dt-published" datetime="2017-04-13 05:00:12 -1000">Apr 13, 2017</time></a>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>In today&rsquo;s fast-paced world, distractions abound, and most of them come from our electronic devices. It&rsquo;s disheartening to see people with their faces buried in their phones, seemingly disconnected from the world around them. Personally, I reached a breaking point with digital distractions and decided to take action. Here&rsquo;s what I did to regain control of my life.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>At one point, I had more than four screens of apps on my iPhone, and I know many people who have even more. It became overwhelming, and I often forgot where an app was among the numerous screens of mostly unused apps. I realized that I had turned organizing my apps into a game, constantly shuffling them around in search of the perfect arrangement.</p>
<p>So, I decided to purge. I deleted the time-wasting &ldquo;social&rdquo; apps from my phone without hesitation. If I wanted to spend time on Facebook, I would intentionally make time for it. Now, I rarely check Facebook, and I&rsquo;ve even reduced my &ldquo;friend&rdquo; list to only include people I actually know. I also experimented with moving the remaining apps I didn&rsquo;t absolutely need to a folder on the second home screen. If I used an app frequently, it earned a promotion back to the first home screen. After a month, I ended up with just 16 apps on my first screen, including the four essential ones in the dock.</p>
<p>For apps that I didn&rsquo;t touch after two months, I removed them from my phone completely. I realized that I could always download them again if I needed them. This approach has helped me stay focused when using my phone, and I now regularly evaluate my home screen to remove or demote apps that don&rsquo;t serve a purpose.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>To further reduce distractions, I set most app notifications on my phone to badge only. No sounds, vibrations, banners, or alerts that can disrupt my concentration. I check my apps on my own schedule, not dictated by notifications. Of course, there are exceptions to this rule. Phone and Messages notifications are necessary for communication, and I also allow notifications for my task management and calendar apps. However, I turned on &ldquo;Do Not Disturb&rdquo; mode between 10 pm and 6 am to have uninterrupted time for sleep and focus in the morning.</p>
<p>Breaking free from the constant need to check notifications was challenging at first, but with time, I found myself picking up my phone less frequently and being more productive throughout the day. It&rsquo;s liberating to not be tethered to my phone all the time.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>As a family, we decided to set limits on when and where electronic devices are acceptable. For example, we have a strict rule of no phones at the table during meals, whether at home or in a restaurant. During family gatherings, we put away our devices in pockets or purses, allowing us to connect with each other face-to-face. We may use phones for taking photos, but we remind each other to stay present and not get lost in our devices. This approach has helped us be more mindful and present in our interactions.</p>
<p>These are some of the strategies I&rsquo;ve employed to combat digital distractions and regain control of my life. It&rsquo;s a continuous process, and I sometimes slip up, but overall, I&rsquo;ve found that I&rsquo;m more aware of my device usage and more engaged with the world around me. If you&rsquo;re also looking to reduce digital distractions, I encourage you to give these strategies a try. You might be surprised by the positive impact it can have on your life.</p>

			 <p>Saying no can be hard, but it&rsquo;s a powerful tool that can bring positive change in our lives. It&rsquo;s not about weakness; it&rsquo;s about strength, prioritization, and self-care. When we have the courage to say no, we stop spreading ourselves too thin and make more time for what truly matters. Here are some key areas where saying no can have a profound impact:</p>

			 <p>Life is cyclical, and we often find ourselves chasin new things only to lose interest in them. We&rsquo;ve become addicted to instant gratification and caught up in the pursuit of material possessions, but what if we intentionally slowed down and rediscovered the wonder of the world around us?</p>
<p>As children, we played and marveled at the world with curiosity. We listened to our inner voices without distractions. But as adults, we get caught up in the busyness of life, chasing after dreams and possessions, constantly connected to our smart devices. But are we truly content? Is our soul at peace?</p>
<p>If there&rsquo;s even a hint of hesitation in our answer, it&rsquo;s time to step back and reflect on the bigger picture. Our time on this Earth is limited, and it would be tragic to reach the end with regrets. Maybe today is the day to stop spinning cycles on unnecessary things that don&rsquo;t truly matter.</p>
<p>The choice has always been ours. Let&rsquo;s choose to slow down, rediscover wonder, and live a more fulfilling life, one that aligns with our true desires and brings us genuine contentment. It&rsquo;s time to break free from the cycle of chasing after empty pursuits and find what truly fulfills us. The power to choose is in our hands.</p>

			<h1><a href="https://jimmitchell.org/2014/10/15/passing-your-salesforce.html">Passing Your Salesforce ADM201 Certification Exam</a></h1>
		

		<a href="https://jimmitchell.org/2014/10/15/passing-your-salesforce.html" class="u-url"><time class="dt-published" datetime="2014-10-15 12:00:22 -1000">Oct 15, 2014</time></a>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>I passed the Salesforce ADM201 certification exam today. It‚Äôs been a five-year road to get here. From the first week I began working with Salesforce, I decided attaining certification was something I wanted to pursue.<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>Now that I‚Äôve done it, I thought it might be good to share the things that helped me be successful with those looking to do the same.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Your success or failure pretty much boils down to this‚Ä¶ You‚Äôve got to know your stuff or it‚Äôs never going to happen.</p>
<p>The Salesforce ADM201 certification exam is not a walk in the park. You‚Äôll never pass it by just reading the online help, or taking online practice tests and studying flash cards ‚Äî most of which are badly outdated, or just plain wrong.</p>
<p>You‚Äôre going to need to be familiar with just about every area of Salesforce and how it actually works ‚Äî where and how you can do something, and where and why you can‚Äôt do something else.</p>
<p>This means getting a developer org and configuring it just like you would if you were doing it for your day job or a client. Be creative in your approach. Try doing things you‚Äôve never done. Try to break it. Enter real data and learn how it flows through the system from a Campaign to a converted Lead to a resolved Case.</p>
<p>Learn it, live it, be it‚Ä¶</p>
<p>Do everything in your power to wrap your head around the big picture of what Salesforce does and totally understand it. That‚Äôs what being a good admin is all about anyway ‚Äî knowing what can or can‚Äôt be done.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>I can‚Äôt stress this one enough.</p>
<p>My employer was kind enough to purchase a year of Premiere Plus Support in order to provide me the online courses to pursue certification, and I did all 60+ hours of both the ADM201 and DEV401 trainings. I learned a lot from it, but it wasn‚Äôt until I joined a study group that the learning really sank in.</p>
<p>Collaborating with a group of your peers introduces fresh ideas, which could give you a completely different perspective about a topic. That, in turn, leads to other moments of discovery. If you‚Äôre serious about earning a certification, I suggest you find others who are as committed as you to passing your exam.</p>
<p>I joined the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Salesforce Certification Study Group<!-- raw HTML omitted -->[efn_note]Thanks to link rot, this site is no longer available.[/efn_note] in the Salesforce Success Community. Deepa Patel and the others who volunteer with the group have worked hard to develop a successful curriculum with a high passing rate for those who are committed enough to make it to the end. It doesn‚Äôt cost any more than your time and effort, plus the $200 to register for your Salesforce ADM201 certification exam, which you‚Äôre going to spend anyway.</p>
<p>Once you‚Äôre accepted into the private group, watch what goes on in the Chatter feed for a while, then when signups for the next round of sessions are announced, join the one that best suits your geographical region.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Okay. You‚Äôve been accepted into the study group. But if you aren‚Äôt totally serious about earning your certification, you‚Äôll never be successful. Period. You‚Äôve got to want it to happen. If you don‚Äôt give studying the attention it needs, you can forget about passing, and may as well stop reading now.</p>
<p>Make it what you think about when you‚Äôre sitting in traffic, brushing your teeth, or taking a shower. Turn off the TV for a couple hours each night and learn something new about Salesforce instead. Choose to become obsessed for a while.</p>
<p>If you end up joining the certification study group, make time to do the work you‚Äôre supposed to do before the next session ‚Äî every single week. Commit to the 15 weeks the group is going to require from you. Be ready to demo your work for the online sessions. Know exactly what you did, why you did it, and have a reason for it. I promise you‚Äôll learn incredible amounts if you commit to working this way.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Be 100% honest with yourself. Ask yourself ‚ÄúAm I <!-- raw HTML omitted -->really<!-- raw HTML omitted --> ready to pursue certification?‚Äù If you‚Äôve only been working with Salesforce a few months, it‚Äôs going to be a tough row to hoe, even with the help and support of a study group ‚Äî who may not be too keen helping you along while studying themselves.</p>
<p>Being part of a group requires commitment. People are depending on you to have ideas that could be different than theirs. Are you <!-- raw HTML omitted -->really<!-- raw HTML omitted --> ready to commit to a group of 6‚Äì12 people for 15 weeks, and collaborate with them? Are you <!-- raw HTML omitted -->really<!-- raw HTML omitted --> ready to do 5 to 8 hours of homework each week? It‚Äôs going to take serious sacrifice.</p>
<p>If you‚Äôre not ready, then wait until you are. You have a better chance of succeeding if you do. By joining the study group without enough experience, chances are you‚Äôll fall behind fast, which is going to discourage you. Don‚Äôt set yourself up to fail. Be ready.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>I mentioned the online tests and flash cards earlier. Don‚Äôt rely on them at all. Salesforce adds lots of new features at each release. Flash cards and tests from the Spring ‚Äô11 release are full of misinformation now. If you rely on them to know your stuff, you might not know much at all.</p>
<p>There is one good resource I‚Äôll personally endorse, and that‚Äôs John Coppedge‚Äôs <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Certified On Demand<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.</p>
<p>I joined while John was developing the site, but would have no hesitation spending the $40 lifetime membership that he‚Äôs asking for now. It‚Äôs a good resource that‚Äôs kept current. The questions he‚Äôs developed are quite similar to the real test (but not actual questions, and are just a little easier).</p>
<p>Consider supporting John‚Äôs efforts and buying a lifetime membership. Use Certified On Demand as a supplement to studying with the Salesforce Certification Study Group. It helped me be confident I was ready when I started doubting myself.</p>
<p>The only other resource you need now is to watch the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Dreamforce Get Started on the Certified Administrator Credential<!-- raw HTML omitted -->[efn_note]Link rot got this one too. Too bad, it was a great resource.[/efn_note] workshop video. It provides solid advice for being ready, how to take the Salesforce ADM201 certification exam, and knowing what you‚Äôre walking into.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>You‚Äôve scheduled your test, and now it‚Äôs time to go take it.</p>
<p>There‚Äôs only one thing to be said‚Ä¶ Know that you know what you know. If you‚Äôve worked hard in the Salesforce Certification Study Group, you‚Äôre ready to pass. Walk into the exam knowing that fact.</p>
<p>When you sit down to begin, take a minute to breathe and relax. Then start your exam using the techniques you learned from the workshop video. Before you know it, you‚Äôll be waking out of the testing center as a Salesforce Certified Administrator.</p>

			 <p>I was asked to find a solution for our field reps that would simplify the process of adding a completed task to their activities when they visited one of our retail stores.<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>We keep our retail locations in Salesforce.com as contacts under a master account, which is shared with all users using a special account sharing rule.</p>
<p>The solution I came up with was a simple flow that limited users to a specific set of enterable information, pre-filling the date of the activity, and marking the task complete when the activity was committed. Literally, the only thing they needed to do was select a picklist value and enter a comment about their visit. It was exactly what we were looking for.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>The thing I didn‚Äôt like about the flow was that when a user entered it, context kind of got lost ‚Äì meaning they started out from a contact record, but didn‚Äôt have a good visual cue about where they were once they got into the flow.</p>
<p>Sure, the flow was simple, but to me it‚Äôs still poor UX not to know the context of your work at all times. So, I decided to use a Visualforce page to solve the problem:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>The trouble with this was that after the flow data was committed, the user would be returned to the beginning of the flow. That‚Äôs definitely not what I wanted. I needed to go back to the contact record I started from.</p>
<p>So I added the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->finishLocation<!-- raw HTML omitted --> attribute to the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&lt;flow:interview /&gt;<!-- raw HTML omitted --> component tag. It would make sense that if I passed the Contact Id, the flow should return to the Contact record:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Nope. That didn‚Äôt do it. When the flow is entered, context gets lost, so Salesforce doesn‚Äôt really know where the user is anymore. Even using the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->vContact<!-- raw HTML omitted --> Apex parameter didn‚Äôt work.</p>
<p>I searched help documentation for an answer, but it wasn‚Äôt all that helpful. I searched Communities and came up empty. Then I searched the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Salesforce Stack Exchange<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, where the only solution I could find was really convoluted, and didn‚Äôt even come close to solving my problem. I was vexed.</p>
<p>Taking a break to get a cup of coffee, a solution dawned on me that turned out to be pretty darned simple. All I needed was an Apex variable in the page, which I could pass to the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->finishLocation<!-- raw HTML omitted --> component tag once the flow was complete. Oddly enough, this method is not documented ‚Äì at least not that I could find.</p>
<p>So‚Ä¶the final Visualforce page:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Using the Apex variable, users where returned to the contact record they started from, and could see the task they just added in the activity history related list. This was exactly what I was looking for. Everyone was happy.</p>
<p>If you need to return to a starting point when using flows and Visualforce pages, consider giving this solution a try.</p>

			 <p>I‚Äôve been working on a force.com app with the requirement that a user must enter a valid email address on a Visualforce page before being able to save a record.</p>
<p>But they must also be able to insert the related contact‚Äôs email address by clicking a button instead of having to leave the edit page to go find it. That seemed simple enough, but it wasn‚Äôt. This is my solution for making a field appear required on a Visualforce page.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>In my original Visualforce page, it seemed logical that if I set the recipient email field as required, all would work as expected. However, defining the field as required prevented my custom action in my page controller from firing and entering the email address.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>In this example, the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->fillEmail()<!-- raw HTML omitted --> action should select the related contact email address, and put the value in the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Recipient_Email__c<!-- raw HTML omitted --> field so the user can see it.</p>
<p>But it‚Äôs not that simple it seems. When the field had the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->required=‚Äútrue‚Äù<!-- raw HTML omitted --> attribute set, the action would not fire because all validation is done on the client side and the page never posts back to the server ‚Äî so the controller action never gets called.</p>
<p>So after some digging and asking for help on the Salesforce discussion boards, the solution was to make the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Recipient_Email__c<!-- raw HTML omitted --> appear as if it‚Äôs required on the page (though it‚Äôs really not), and add a new save method to my controller to handle field validation on the server side when the record gets saved.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Notice the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&lt;apex:pageblocksectionitem /&gt;<!-- raw HTML omitted --> code to replace the original field. This is how we make the field appear with the ‚Äúrequired‚Äù bar. A nifty trick that took some digging to discover. Hopefully, this post saves someone else the time it took me to figure it out ‚Äî and me the time when I forget it.</p>
<p>For convenience, here‚Äôs a Github Gist with field label &amp; inline help that shows exactly how to make a field appear required on a Visualforce page.</p>

			 <p>Today I had the need to add a bunch of named text files to a folder in the Finder on my Mac.</p>
<p>I found it a major pain to open BBEdit, make a new document, save it to where I wanted it, and then manually copy &amp; rename the file back in the Finder. A lot of effort just to get 7 or 8 empty files with different names.</p>
<p>So, I threw together this little AppleScript to add empty files instead. The gist is once launched in the Finder (using <!-- raw HTML omitted -->FastScripts<!-- raw HTML omitted --> by <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Red Sweater<!-- raw HTML omitted --> naturally. Keystroke: cmd+option+shift+N), a dialog pops up that lets you enter a file title. Then the Finder creates that file in the front-most window. If no window is open, the file is added to your Desktop.</p>
<p>I found this to be more than twice as fast as the ‚Äútraditional‚Äù method of making several files. Hopefully, it can help you out too. Remember, use it with <!-- raw HTML omitted -->FastScripts<!-- raw HTML omitted --> for quick keystroke access. Save as a script in the ‚ÄúFinder‚Äù scripts folder <!-- raw HTML omitted -->(‚Äú~/Library/Scripts/Applications/Finder/‚Äù)<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.</p>

			 <p>Some time ago, I set up my Gmail account in Apple Mail to copy over messages which were not sent to my jimmitchellmedia.net account. I‚Äôm one of those guys who likes to have everything all in one place at my finger tips when I need it.<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>After copying over the messages I wanted, I completely removed the Gmail IMAP account from Mail and went about my business. Soon after, when I went searching for a specific email, I experienced the phenomenon of ghost emails in the search results.</p>
<p>These are messages that Mail once knew about, but no longer knows where they exist. The ghost emails were all from the since removed Gmail account.</p>
<p>If you‚Äôre experiencing the same problem, here‚Äôs a very simple fix to rebuild the Apple Mail envelope index.</p>
<p>First, quit Apple Mail if it‚Äôs running, then navigate your way to ‚Äú~/Library/Mail/‚Äù (where ‚Äú<!-- raw HTML omitted -->‚Äù<!-- raw HTML omitted --> is your home folder) in the Finder. Once you‚Äôre in the Mail folder, you‚Äôll see a file named ‚ÄúEnvelope Index‚Äù which keeps track of where all messages are located. Rename ‚ÄúEnvelope Index‚Äù to ‚ÄúEnvelope Index Backup‚Äù (We don‚Äôt want to trash the file just yet).</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Then, relaunch Apple Mail. You‚Äôll be presented with a daunting ‚ÄúMessage Import‚Äù dialog that looks like your email account was wiped out and you‚Äôre starting all over. Fear not. You‚Äôre simply rebuilding the Envelope Index at this point.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Click ‚ÄúContinue‚Äù to rebuild the index. Once it‚Äôs done, all those pesky phantom messages will be gone the next time you perform a search in Mail (Yay!). You can then go back to the ‚Äú~/Library/Mail/‚Äù folder in the Finder and move the file you renamed to ‚ÄúEnvelope Index Backup‚Äù to the Trash.</p>
<p>And there it is. Your Apple Mail Envelope index has been rebuilt. A very simple solution to a problem that has baffled some of the best Mac users.</p>
