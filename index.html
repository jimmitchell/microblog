			 <p>My wife, son and I went to a local restaurant to have an early New Year&rsquo;s Eve dinner. I was happy to see that the 20 or so TVs they had in the establishment were all VIZIO 65&quot; P-Series models. Thanks for paying some of my paycheck!</p>

			 <p>New Year&rsquo;s Day means three things in the Mitchell house: The Rose Parade on TV, a big bacon and eggs breakfast, and Chili con Carne simmering on the stove. I&rsquo;m adding a twist this year and smoking a round cut first. I think it&rsquo;ll add a nice twist to an already family favorite.</p>

			 <p>My wife and I walked downtown for coffee and to check out the waves. Since our beach is south-facing, the wrap around west swell is producing unorganized closeout mush. We decided it wasn&rsquo;t worth the extra walk to the pier for a closer look. The coffee from Philz was excellent, as it always is.</p>

			 <p>I picked up a license for <a href="https://flyingmeat.com/acorn/">Acorn 8.0</a> this morning and immediately started playing with features. One of the gradient presets was a cool blurred Apple six-color sequence, which I of course had to make into a macOS wallpaper.</p>
<p>I think the results turned out pretty decent; decent enough to use as my own wallpaper. It looks great in dark mode.</p>

			 <p>If you&rsquo;re a Micro.blog user who uses my <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->mnml<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --> theme, I made a few updates I&rsquo;ve been ruminating on for a while that makes it a little more customizable.</p>
<p>Once you&rsquo;ve updated from your Micro.blog plugins page, you&rsquo;ll see a new settings option to manage the customizations.</p>
<h3 id="mnml-settings">mnml Settings</h3>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Each of these settings are outlined below&hellip;</p>
<h3 id="the-custom-icon">The Custom Icon</h3>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Many Micro.blog themes are coded to use your main account profile photo for the header image. If you run multiple blogs on the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Premium plan<!-- raw HTML omitted --> and want to use the same theme for each of them, your sites aren&rsquo;t easily distinguishable.</p>
<p>If you <!-- raw HTML omitted -->do<!-- raw HTML omitted --> want to distinguish one site from the other, this setting is how you do it with <!-- raw HTML omitted -->mnml<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. It also saves you from having to use some weird image for your Micro.blog account in order to brand your site the way you want.</p>
<p>All you have to do is add the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->complete URL<!-- raw HTML omitted --> to any image, and it will display instead of your profile photo. I recommend a simple image no larger than 256 pixels square for this, but feel free to experiment.</p>
<p>If you leave the URL field empty, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->mnml<!-- raw HTML omitted --> uses your Micro.blog account profile photo instead.</p>
<p>Easy-peasy.</p>
<h3 id="categories-on-the-archives-page">Categories on the Archives Page</h3>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Some people have asked how they can show their blog&rsquo;s categories on the Archives page, while others have told me how much they like the fact <!-- raw HTML omitted -->mnml<!-- raw HTML omitted --> doesn&rsquo;t do that.</p>
<p>Being the people pleaser I am, I came up with a way to make everyone happy. If you want to show categories, toggle the setting on and like magic, they&rsquo;ll <!-- raw HTML omitted -->show up<!-- raw HTML omitted --> just like in the screenshot above. If you don&rsquo;t want to display them, leave the setting off.</p>
<h3 id="footer-credits">Footer Credits</h3>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Lastly, I&rsquo;ve added a credit line to the footer of <!-- raw HTML omitted -->mnml<!-- raw HTML omitted --> to drive people to Micro.blog, the theme&rsquo;s Github page, or my own site.</p>
<p>Some of you may not mind having something like this at the bottom of your site pages, and I&rsquo;m grateful to those who leave it on. But some of you may hate it, so you have the option to turn it off completely. I won&rsquo;t be hurt if you do.</p>
<p>Finally, if you&rsquo;re someone who likes and/or uses <!-- raw HTML omitted -->mnml<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, consider supporting my development efforts. Just a <!-- raw HTML omitted -->buck a month<!-- raw HTML omitted --> from a handful of people makes all the difference in the world towards enhancements like these.</p>
<p>Enjoy!</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Let me know questions<!-- raw HTML omitted --> or if you think of an enhancement I might not have.</p>

			 <p>I&rsquo;m up early this morning. My plan was to get up at 4:00 am, put the turkey in brine and then go back to bed for a few hours. But as my mind is prone to do, I began pondering all the things in my life I&rsquo;m thankful for. So I thought I&rsquo;d share some of them.</p>
<p>The greatest thing that ever happened in my life is my spouse and life partner. Our meeting was totally by chance thanks to circumstances that aligned perfectly and a single photograph. Had one of them been just a little bit different, we would have never crossed paths. We married after a nine-month courtship &ndash; and not for the reason you may be thinking. We were young and foolish and rushed into the permanence of marriage. A lot of people said we wouldn&rsquo;t make it past three years, and there were challenges that took hard work, but after more than 31 years, I can&rsquo;t imagine having spent them with anyone else. She&rsquo;s the rock that keeps me grounded and my inspiration to keep moving forward.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m grateful for my kids and the impact they&rsquo;ve had in my life. When my wife and I met, she had two young children from a prior marriage. I took them on as my own since their father chose not to be part of the picture. Then we had our own child together. Raising children humbles a man &ndash; especially when raising step-children. I won&rsquo;t lie; there were hard times and challenges with them over the last three decades, but all three turned out to be level-headed moral adults. I&rsquo;m proud of the individual each of them have become and am humbled to see a tiny reflection of me in them.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m thankful I was given the chance to recover my health. This year was a wake up call. It&rsquo;s been nearly ten months since &ldquo;<a href="https://jimmitchell.org/2024/03/06/on-the-fragility.html">the episode</a>&rdquo; and it still rattles me that it could have been the end of it all. I see life differently now and am grateful for every morning I open my eyes, even when I don&rsquo;t seem like it.</p>
<p>I appreciate that someone who is now a very close friend took the time to mentor me in my darkest hour and when my outlook of the future was grim. He listened to me bitch about a lot of stupid stuff for almost ten years, but always challenged me to look at it from a different angle. I&rsquo;m a completely different person thanks to his wisdom. I&rsquo;ll forever be in his debt for the change he made in me.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m glad for my job and the career path I landed in totally by mistake. I may gripe about the grind of it sometimes, but I love that I&rsquo;m challenged by the work. It allows me to be creative and bring something to life that makes the lives of others a little better. I&rsquo;m blessed to enjoy doing what I do for a living.</p>
<p>Then, I&rsquo;m thankful for the little things. Life is magical when you take the time to step back and look at it. Every moment in your life, good or bad, has lead to this moment, whether it&rsquo;s good or bad. This good or bad moment will lead to other good and bad moments. It&rsquo;s a godsend to be able to look back and see how it&rsquo;s unfolded over a lifetime. I&rsquo;m truly a very lucky man.</p>
<p>Of course, I&rsquo;m thankful for you and the fact you took the time to read what I&rsquo;ve just written. I&rsquo;m fortunate to have connected with some awesome people online. Though you and I may never meet IRL, I&rsquo;m glad you share the insight into your life by what you write, and that you care enough about my own life to engage back with me.</p>
<p>Happy Thanksgiving to those who celebrate&hellip;</p>

			 <p>I took some time off work during the Thanksgiving holiday after grinding on a work project for a really long time. I&rsquo;ve found myself at a point over the last six months where I just don&rsquo;t feel effective and needed to figure out why.</p>
<p>During my quiet time this morning, I picked up <em>&quot;<a href="https://sive.rs/n">Hell Yeah or No</a>&quot;</em> by Derek Sivers again. I bought the physical book a couple months ago with a plan to finish it quickly. But, as I tend to do, I read about 10 pages and then set it aside, telling myself I&rsquo;ll get back to it eventually.</p>
<p>As I was powering through the book&rsquo;s anecdotes, one jumped <a href="https://sive.rs/no2">off the page</a> and grabbed my attention.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Hell yeah or no&rdquo; is a filter you can use to decide what&rsquo;s worth doing. But this is simpler and more serious. <strong>This is a decision to stop deciding.</strong> It&rsquo;s one decision, in advance, that the answer to all future distractions is &ldquo;no&rdquo; until you finish what you started. <strong>It&rsquo;s saying yes to one thing, and no to absolutely everything else.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>I struck me that I&rsquo;ve been saying yes far too often again. I&rsquo;ll get a great idea for a project and dive head first into it, while having a half-dozen similar projects already in the works.</p>
<p>There are also commitments to others I&rsquo;ve said yes to that I don&rsquo;t want to show up for anymore. I have a bad habit of volunteering for something without thinking it through and it eventually becomes a drain on my energy.</p>
<p>What I need to do is focus on the &ldquo;one big thing for now,&rdquo; and only that thing until it&rsquo;s finished. Everything else new is a hard no. There are still those commitments I have to show up for, but I don&rsquo;t have to put 100% effort into them until the one big thing is done.</p>
<p>The challenge now is to figure out what that one big thing is.</p>

			 <p>I went to bed concerned with what I was seeing, but with the hope that democracy would do its thing and a tyrant would be defeated. I was confident common sense and a <strong>true</strong> sense of patriotism would prevail. I slept soundly.</p>
<p>I awoke to what I can only see as a disastrous future. I&rsquo;m stunned, sickened, angry and scared all at the same time.</p>
<p>I have no words. I have many thoughts, but no words.</p>
<p>When this man was elected in 2016, I was not a fan of the outcome. My wife and I didn&rsquo;t vote for him ourselves and we were sure then democracy would prevail.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, he ended up president elect and, though we thought better of it, my wife and I agreed we&rsquo;d support the Office of the President since that&rsquo;s what a good American does: Win or lose, you accept the outcome and support your country&rsquo;s leader.</p>
<p>We changed our minds pretty damn fast.</p>
<p>Eight years later, we&rsquo;re looking at another four years of what I can only call pure hell.</p>
<p>Has history taught us nothing?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m stunned. I&rsquo;m sickened. I&rsquo;m angry. And I&rsquo;m scared.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m stunned, sickened, angry and scared because more than half of our nation believes an unhinged man with fascist tendencies is the best option to lead our country.</p>
<p>What have we come to?</p>
<p>Rome was once a great nation, but its time eventually came to an end. How close is America to its fall?</p>

			 <p>Since this question will likely come sooner or later&hellip;</p>
<p>When I was developing <a href="https://micro.blog/account/plugins/view/138">mnml</a>, I wanted to give users the ability to set their own link colors for both light and dark modes. However, in my testing, there were challenges that would have caused colors a user set to get overwritten if I needed to release an update. So, another approach was needed.</p>
<p>If you end up using mnml yourself and want to change link colors, here&rsquo;s how you do it&hellip;</p>
<p>In your Micro.blog custom CSS settings, add the following CSS snippet, adjusting the hex colors as you like. This example gets you a nice <!-- raw HTML omitted -->magenta<!-- raw HTML omitted --> color for both light and dark modes.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-css" data-lang="css">:<span style="color:#a6e22e">root</span> {

			 <p>Taking ideas from a few others, I&rsquo;m going to try something new and start a long form post of things that happened during the week. The goal is a stream of consciousness that gets published with minimal editing. Just write and publish &ndash; though <em>some</em> copy editing is allowed&hellip;</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s been a few weeks since I <a href="https://jimmitchell.org/2024/10/11/and-just-like.html">returned to Micro.blog</a>. I&rsquo;d let my account lapse and was simply going to focus all my efforts on the WordPress VPS I was running. But the drama in that community kind of soured me. I could have ignored it and just plodded on, but it was really the breakpoint of several other things that made me decide to abandon it. In my return, I was reminded just how engaging the Micro.blog community is. I&rsquo;m glad to be back.</p>
<p>I managed to snarf my Mastodon presence by moving around a little too much. When I started, I had a whopping 94 followers. By the time I was done, I was down to just seven. Thanks to <a href="https://social.lol/@ameripie">Lou Plummer</a> for the <a href="https://social.lol/@amerpie/113359642081637291">shoutout</a> to help me recover a little (thanks Lou). I gained some interesting new followers in it. I&rsquo;m not back to 94, but then I&rsquo;m not at seven either&hellip;</p>
<p>I forked a couple of <a href="https://micro.blog/manton">Manton&rsquo;s</a> Micro.blog plugins and tweaked them for my own needs. One of them turned out good enough that I might release it as a new plugin for others. Or, I might do a pull request on his version so he can include my features if he likes. I&rsquo;m not sure which approach I&rsquo;m going to take yet.</p>
<p>I took a refresher course on first-aid and CPR this week. I was certified as a Boy Scout in my early teen years to get my first-aid merit badge. Some things have changed since, but for the most part, I remembered it all and was the class star pupil.</p>
<p>Stepping on the scale this morning, my app says I&rsquo;ve lost a total of 53.4 lbs since the height of the pandemic, which is encouraging. I&rsquo;m at a weight lower than I was in high school and I&rsquo;m wearing a pant size smaller than I can ever recall. Sugar is my nemesis and I have to battle it daily &ndash; but I&rsquo;m winning. I almost started making hot chocolate a daily habit this week, but came to my senses after a couple of days.</p>
<p>I plan to get my head back into SwiftUI this week. I was progressing well, but let fatigue from the day job get the better of me over the last month &ndash; which I used as an excuse to sit on my butt and watch YouTube videos. The goal to resurrect my old apps will get nowhere if I continue like that.</p>
<p>Speaking of the day job, the LRPFH (long-running project from hell) continues to grind on. It was slated to go live back in April of this year, but delays because of one thing or another has pushed it out to next month &ndash; and that&rsquo;s if all goes well for the next two weeks. I&rsquo;m going to take a two-week vacation away from technology once we get this project fully live, which is supposed to be February 2025.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s it for this week. We&rsquo;ll see if the Week Log series continues next week.</p>
<p>Time for the first meeting of the day&hellip;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>It‚Äôs not clear what security problem Mullenweg is referring to in the post. He writes that he‚Äôs ‚Äúinvoking point 18 of the plugin directory guidelines,‚Äù in which the WordPress team reserves several rights, including removing a plugin, or changing it ‚Äúwithout developer consent.‚Äù Mullenweg explains that the move has to do with WP Engine‚Äôs recently-filed lawsuit against him and Automattic.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>To me, Mullenweg is totally abusing his power as the &ldquo;sole owner&rdquo; of WordPress.org here, and (as others point out) has forced a hostile takeover of the work of other developers. If he can do it for one, he can do it for all. I want no part of this kind of &ldquo;open source&rdquo; drama. It was the final straw in me abandoning the WordPress platform completely.</p>
<p>Though I have a couple of plugins of my own in the repository, I&rsquo;ll only be maintaining them for security reasons. I considered pulling them altogether, but I don&rsquo;t want to leave any users who may be using them stranded.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>Remember the late 90s and early 2000s when personal blogs were <em>the</em> thing? Everybody had one and they were like online journals; authentic, raw, and an outlet for personal thoughts, ideas, and sometimes questionable opinions.</p>
<p>It kind of feels like those days are behind us, buried under the avalanche of social media. But are they really?</p>
<h3 id="social-media-and-the-decline-of-the-blog">Social Media and the Decline of the Blog</h3>
<p>It didn‚Äôt happen overnight. Personal blogs didn‚Äôt just disappear in one big poof. It was more like a slow fade. As Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter took off, people ‚Äì me included ‚Äì found it easier to share bite-sized pieces of life. Why write a long, reflective post to publish on your personal site when you could sum it up in a quick status update that some ‚Äúfriend‚Äù you don‚Äôt really even know could give you a mindless like?</p>
<p>Therein lies the rub. Social media is all about convenience ‚Äì fast, visual, and designed for quick consumption ‚Äì like fast food for the mind. Scroll, like, move on. Blogs, on the other hand, ask for your time and thought. They‚Äôre like the home-cooked meals we don‚Äôt have time for anymore.</p>
<h3 id="loss-of-depth">Loss of Depth</h3>
<p>Blogs were once a place for people to dive deep into ideas, emotions, and experiences. It wasn‚Äôt about only broadcasting the best parts of your life, but reflecting on the messiness, struggles, and painful lessons. You could get to know someone through their writing ‚Äì see how they think, feel, and evolve over time.</p>
<p>Social media, on the other hand, with its character limits and algorithms pushing sensational, click-worthy content, doesn‚Äôt offer the same depth. Everything is a sizzle reel. You can still share long posts or threads, but how often do people really read them? We‚Äôve learned to skim content, always hungry for the next hit of dopamine from a new notification or like.</p>
<h3 id="why-blogs-mattered-and-still-do">Why Blogs Mattered‚Ä¶ And Still Do</h3>
<p>There‚Äôs something about the personal blog that social media can‚Äôt replace. It‚Äôs not just about the writing. It‚Äôs about ownership. On a blog, you control the narrative. There‚Äôs no algorithm deciding whether a post will be seen or buried. Your thoughts are out there for whoever chooses to engage with them, free from the noise of sponsored or promoted posts and trending hashtags.</p>
<p>While social media offers instant gratification ‚Äì likes, short comments, shares ‚Äì a blog provides something deeper: connection. Real connection, with people who take the time to engage with your words because they want to, not because a platform nudged them into it.</p>
<h3 id="the-shift-to-niche-and-professional-blogging">The Shift to Niche and Professional Blogging</h3>
<p>Blogs were never really dead, but they‚Äôve changed a lot since the early days. A good personal blog is hard to find now. Instead, we see more niche or professional blogs, where people share expert advice, reviews, or tutorials. These are useful, but often lack a personal touch that made blogging feel intimate back in the day.</p>
<p>Many of those people have turned their personal blogs into a business, focusing on SEO and monetization rather than genuine self-expression. While there‚Äôs nothing wrong with making money, it‚Äôs a far cry from the humble beginnings of blogging as a space for pure, unfiltered thoughts.</p>
<p>To be clear; you will never see an ad on my blog. This space is purely for my rumination ‚Äì be it good or bad ‚Äì and interactions with those who read.</p>
<h3 id="can-personal-blogging-make-a-comeback">Can Personal Blogging Make a Comeback?</h3>
<p>Maybe. There‚Äôs a growing disdain against the superficiality of social media. People are beginning to tire of the endless scrolling, filtered versions of someone else‚Äôs perfect life, and the pressure to perform. People are coming back around to authenticity and real conversations. There‚Äôs no better place for that than a personal blog.</p>
<p>For those of us who still love the art of long-form writing, and who crave meaningful connections over mindless scrolling, personal blogs offer a haven. My site may not get the instant attention or the engagement of a social post, but that‚Äôs the point ‚Äì it‚Äôs meant for something deeper.</p>
<p>Is social media the death of the personal blog? Not quite. It may have nearly killed it, yes. But for those of us willing to carve out our own space in the digital landscape, personal blogs still have a heartbeat. It just takes more effort to keep it alive.</p>
<p>What do you think? Is blogging a lost art, or is there hope for a revival? Start (or join) the conversation in the comments below. Or write about it on your own blog if you still have one and link back to this post. My site will automatically link back to yours ‚Äì just like in the old days.</p>
<p>It‚Äôs time to get meaningful conversations happening again. Personal blogs are the perfect place for it.</p>

			 <p>I remember the first time I touched a computer. I was in my early twenties and worked as a customer service rep for the local water company, which is a fancy way of saying I played in the mud on an almost daily basis.</p>
<p>I was in the main office and the company had just switched over from a paper and pencil method of recording meter readings to a hand-held reader, which got connected to the computer after reading a route for the day to upload results. It was definitely a lot faster and saved the meter readers from having to take a bunch of books out on their routes each day.</p>
<p>As a CSR, I had to be able to lookup a customer information, such as when they last paid their bill, the meter readings for the last number of months and so on.</p>
<p>Lou Plummer‚Äôs post about a <a href="https://louplummer.lol/a-computer-is-a-hammer/">computer being a hammer</a> reminded me of how scared I was to touch the thing, worried I would somehow mess something up and cause everything to crash. But I learned it, and soon found it to be a useful tool.</p>
<p>Fast forward a few years. I realized that playing in the mud was not something I wanted to do for the rest of my life, so I pursued learning accounting at one of those fly-by-night technical colleges that were prolific in the early nineties. This is where I learned to type by touch ‚Äì a skill a lot of people could still use to learn.</p>
<p>After graduating the tech college, I landed an accounting job at Guitar Center corporate, which you‚Äôd think would be a musician‚Äôs dream. I found it to be boring with little opportunity for creative expression. After moving from accounting to the inventory management team, I first got my hands on a Mac SE.</p>
<p>I would travel to the stores across the country and inventory their hardware and accessories. The Mac SE was used to reconcile the serialized product they kept on 3‚Äú x 5‚Äù index cards to our inventory sheets. This is where I learned 10-key by touch. I also learned how to use MacPaint and Excel to create flyers for the band I was in.</p>
<p>I went on to another company doing clerical that also gave me access to a Mac. This is where I started helping others with their Mac problems. What they didn‚Äôt know is I was figuring it out on the fly, learning as I fixed their computer. I have a mind for problem solving, so I looked like a hero to my coworkers. I was still doing band flyers with MacPaint and Excel too.</p>
<p>The staff design artist decided he wanted to move on. He and I had established a rapport with each other as Mac bros, and when he left, I just sort of fell into his position. This is how I moved from accounting to design. The company was generous enough to send me to school where I got my degree in design. My new career path gave me full-time access to a Mac. I was in heaven. This is when learned the fine art of FTP.</p>
<p>I started hearing about this thing called the internet, which led me to sign up for AOL for a while. I moved on to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EWorld">eWorld</a> shortly after. I still think eWorld was way better than AOL.</p>
<p>I somehow stumbled on this thing called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FidoNet">FidoNet</a> that is a network of individual computers. I began running my own <a href="https://hermesbbs.com/about/">Heremes BBS</a> on a discarded Mac SE and put it up as a node the FidoNet network. I was finally online and had access to my own personal email. I‚Äôd tweak settings endlessly, learning about communication protocols. The year I ran that BBS was one of the most enlightening in my tech journey.</p>
<p>After that, I moved to an online internet provider named Z4 Internet that gave me a place to host my own web pages. This is how I taught myself to code html by hand using BBEdit. No WYSIWYG editors for this guy.</p>
<p>The years between then and now are a blur, but from then on, I was forever a traveler of the ‚Äúinternet super-highway‚Äù as I once put it to my wife. She thought I was a dork when I said it, but she gets it now.</p>
<p>At my next employer, I moved from design into database and web development where I learned to code Java, Javascript, and PHP while honing my html and css skills. By a stroke of luck, I landed in the <a href="https://www.salesforce.com">Salesforce</a> ecosystem nearly 15 years ago and have remained there ever since.</p>
<p>Somewhere in those years, I developed a Mac utility app named <a href="https://yasuformac.com">Yasu</a>, which was short for ‚ÄúYet another system utility.‚Äù I‚Äôll have to write a story about that time one day. Being an indie Mac developer were some of the best years of my life.</p>
<p>My journey has been a series of right place, right time moments. I wouldn‚Äôt change any of them to be where I am today. I sometimes think back to that time I was so afraid to touch a keyboard at the water company. I can‚Äôt imagine a life without technology now. It‚Äôs allowed me some of my most creatively explosive growth and connections with people that mean a lot to me.</p>
<p>I‚Äôve been blessed by my time on the internet to say the least.</p>

			 <p>Here‚Äôs another one of those childhood memories that left a scar; literally. This one is about the time I tried to stop my out of control bicycle using a barbed wire fence.</p>
<p>It was probably as painful as it sounds. Honestly, I can‚Äôt remember if it was.</p>
<p>Around the time I was <a href="https://jimmitchell.dev/2018/04/28/memorable-cigarettes.html">stealing cigarettes from my mother</a>, I was also learning how to ride a bicycle. Wicked step-father and mom didn‚Äôt want to teach me. I was simply handed a bike and left to figure it out on my own.</p>
<p>Self-reliance ended up being a theme throughout my childhood, and is a big reason for my reluctance to rely on others to this day. Mom thought she was doing me a favor, but I‚Äôm not too sure about that decision‚Ä¶</p>
<p>Anyway, the bike mom and wicked step-father brought home for me was a <a href="https://i.pinimg.com/originals/b5/c6/f5/b5c6f5889ee84685949bfa1b001df6e4.jpg">blue and white Schwinn girl‚Äôs model</a>. I recall that it <em>looked</em> fairly new, so they must‚Äôve spent some amount of money on it ‚Äì but dammit, it was a <em>girl‚Äôs</em> bike. Thank god we lived on a farm with no other kids around. I would have been the laughing stock of my peers otherwise.</p>
<p>To teach myself how to ride, I would run along beside the bike, and once I was running fast enough, I would let the bike go so it would ‚Äúride‚Äù along by itself. I have no idea why my seven year-old boy brain thought this was the way to learn, but it just seemed right at the time.</p>
<p>This went on for a while with me losing and gaining interest in the bike. Eventually, I somehow learned how to balance and pedal. I can‚Äôt remember how, but it happened because I‚Äôm able to ride a bike today. I have a vague recollection that maybe one of wicked step-father‚Äôs adult sons had pity on me and took it on himself to teach me.</p>
<p>Not long after figuring out how to pedal without falling, I got daring and chose to ride down the quarter-mile long dirt driveway. On the left side was a barbed wire fence, on the right side was a big open wheat field.</p>
<p>Since I hadn‚Äôt mastered the art of using friction brakes, which way do you think I ended up steering when I lost control? You guessed it. I steered towards the barbed wire fence.</p>
<p>As I got close to it, I instinctively reached out for the fence to slow myself down. I quickly learned that one does not simply stop when grabbing barbed wire. Nope. One continues on for a bit as the rusty barbs tear into the palm of your hand before you wind up stopping.</p>
<p>I can‚Äôt recall the pain, but I do remember the blood. Lots of blood. Did I end up getting stitches? No. Should I have? Probably.</p>
<p>After ditching the bike on the side of the driveway, I ran back to the house screaming hysterically, clutching my left wrist while the blood ran down my forearm. My hand looked like hamburger and I was freaked out.</p>
<p>When I got to my mother, she inspected it, washed the cut, put Neosporin on it and wrapped it with a couple Kleenex and the funky pink paper tape she wore at night to keep the curls at her temples in place while she slept. I wouldn‚Äôt call it a good field dressing by any means. There was no tetanus shot, and there definitely wasn‚Äôt a doctor visit.</p>
<p>I don‚Äôt remember anything about the incident after that or how my hand went on to heal, but it did. I think I‚Äôve blocked all of it out. I did go on to ride the blue Schwinn girl‚Äôs bike without hitting any more fences.</p>
<p>It‚Äôs been more than 50 years since this happened and I can still make out the very faint long scar in the palm of my left hand. I always go back to this memory when I see any barbed wire fence. It‚Äôs left both a physical and mental scar that has lasted a lifetime.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>My initial thoughts on the MacBook Air M3 15&quot; fully spec‚Äôd model&hellip;</p>
<ul>
<li>The size, weight and form factor are perfect for me. I love my 13&quot; M1, but I like the 15&quot; M3 more. Typing feels less cramped for my big hands.</li>
<li>Though the M3 is a mere 1/10th of a pound lighter, there seems to be even more of a weight difference between the two. Probably because of the larger overall footprint.</li>
<li>I like the screen much better. At 500 nits vs. 300 for the M1, the screen pops more at full brightness. As a former design artist, this is important to me.</li>
<li>The body has no micro-holes for speakers. I love this. My day job 16&quot; MacBook Pro does, and all kinds of dust gets stuck in the tiny holes. I plan to do some sound comparisons between the M1 and M3 tonight.</li>
<li>The notch was noticeable when I first started setting it up, but after a while it sort of faded into the background. Thankfully <a href="https://www.macbartender.com">Bartender 5&rsquo;s</a> menu bar styles helped with this.</li>
<li>Having a MagSafe charger again is great. I always thought that was a brilliant design and was sad when Apple moved away from it. I&rsquo;m happy to see MagSafe making a comeback. Plus it opens up an extra USB-C port.</li>
<li>I like the smaller screen bezel. It makes the screen feel bigger than it really is.</li>
<li>It&rsquo;s fast. I&rsquo;m glad I got the top spec.</li>
<li>Sadly, it&rsquo;s just a little too wide for my favorite Crumpler messenger bag I&rsquo;ve had for 15+ years. I see a replacement purchase in the near future here.</li>
</ul>
<p>All in all, after just a few hours of use, it‚Äôs a <a href="https://www.apple.com/macbook-air/">purchase</a> I‚Äôm pleased with. More thoughts to come in the next week or two.</p>

			 <p>Events happen in our lives that make us do a full stop and give a long, hard look at how things are. This was one of those events that slapped me in the face so hard I&rsquo;m still having a hard time grasping it.</p>
<p>About a week ago, I had a heart related event that sent me to the emergency room. It was serious enough that the doctor point blank told me it could have been deadly had I not paid attention to it.</p>
<p>When I woke up at 3:30 am last Thursday, my heart was palpitating and racing at over 150 bpm. I thought for sure I was having a heart attack. I woke my wife and we sped to the closest ER (she drove).</p>
<p>When the doctor examined me, my heart was in an state of Afib (<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/atrial-fibrillation/symptoms-causes/syc-20350624">atrial fibrillation</a>). They pumped me full of drugs to bring my heart below 100 bpm and hopefully put me back into a sinus rhythm. They were able to get the heart rate down a little, but it fluctuated between 90 and 120 bpm for hours. They weren&rsquo;t able to get me back into a sinus rhythm either.</p>
<p>Ultimately, I was admitted to the hospital. My heart finally went back into a sinus rhythm after 19 very exhausting hours. After several tests, the cardiologist was able to determine this is a defect I&rsquo;ve had all my life. I&rsquo;d had small episodes as long as I can remember, but never thought anything of it. It&rsquo;s forcing some big changes to my lifestyle. Thankfully, I&rsquo;m still here to write about it.</p>
<p>The most terrible and heartbreaking part of this story is that another man, just a year younger than me (having overheard his age), was put into the ER bed right next to me complaining of excruciating back pain. Like me, he walked in under his own power. Within 30 minutes of arrival, he went unresponsive and ultimately passed away from heart failure. The ER staff worked furiously to bring him back for a long time. At one point he did resuscitate, but before they could get him to the ICU, he crashed again. There was nothing they could do for this man. So tragic.</p>
<p>This all happened right next to my wife and I before we knew what was going on with my own heart. It scared the living shit out of both of us, and I&rsquo;ll never, ever forget it.</p>
<p>Life is <em>really</em> fucking short and can be taken from you in a heartbeat &ndash; literally.</p>
<p>I should not be living to work. I should be working to live a full life with &ndash; and for &ndash; those most important to me. It&rsquo;s easy to get wrapped up in a career. To hell with that now! Family and friends are what matter. And so does living a life that makes a difference to them. It took nearly six decades to see it clearly. I&rsquo;m grateful I was shown the lesson with enough time to do something about it.</p>
<p>No matter what, hold your loved ones close. Let them know you love them every day. Patch the broken relationships even though it&rsquo;s hard. Live each day with gratitude and wonder, because you could be gone in a matter of moments.</p>

<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Without further ado, my list of the top five‚Ä¶</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>I‚Äôve been using <!-- raw HTML omitted -->LaunchBar<!-- raw HTML omitted --> since 2005, probably longer than any other Mac app I currently use, save BBEdit. I set up my wife‚Äôs old 2012 27&quot; iMac last week to install macOS Sonoma via <!-- raw HTML omitted -->OpenCore Legacy Patcher<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, and through each step, I found my muscle memory wanting to launch some app with LaunchBar. I easily use this app a hundred times a day, every day.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>I live and die by my calendar these days. For me, the only calendar application worthy of being used on a Mac is <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Fantastical<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, hands-down. The natural language input is super useful and slick. The premium feature I love the most is Openings. For my work, I‚Äôve got too many people wanting to meet with me for this or that. All I have to do is give them a URL and tell them to find an opening. This has saved me hours. I hate subscriptions, but to me, this app is worth it.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>I‚Äôve been a Chrome user for many years now. But, two things made me change to Safari this year. First, Chrome has become a memory hog. As I write this, for the same five tabs open, Chrome is using 235MB of memory among 45 threads, whereas Safari is only using 151MB across 10 threads. Less memory and thread usage means better battery life. Second is the privacy philosophies between Apple and Google. Enough said on that one.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>I‚Äôve been on Mastodon since 2018, but as the platform becomes more popular and my use picks up, I find myself leaning more and more on <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Ivory<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. I started out with Mona as my Mastodon client ‚Äì which is a great app too ‚Äì but I just find myself gravitating more and more to Ivory. I can‚Äôt put my finger on why.

<p><strong>‚ÄúThere‚Äù is no better than ‚Äúhere‚Äù</strong>. When your ‚Äúthere‚Äù has become a ‚Äúhere‚Äù, you will simply obtain a ‚Äúthere‚Äù that will look better to you than your present ‚Äúhere‚Äù.</p>

			 <p>One of my earliest childhood memories is traumatic. At least it would seem traumatic to a three-and-a-half-year-old little boy. Though it didn‚Äôt turn out to be the end of the world, it seemed like hell when it happened. I still carry the memory with me more than a half-century later, so it damaged me on some level.</p>
<p>My family ‚Äì mother, wicked step-father, newborn baby sister and me ‚Äì were living in an old two-story house in Lancaster, California, which in the late 1960s was still mostly desert scrub and Joshua trees. We were located far enough away from everything else that it could be called the middle of nowhere. Today, a strip mall stands where the house once did.</p>
<p>We were so remote that my mother didn‚Äôt really pay attention to what I was getting into. She trusted I would not stray too far and everything would just work itself out. She had a newborn baby to worry about and didn‚Äôt give me the attention I probably should have gotten. With nothing to do and no watchful eye, I would wander the acre-sized property, trying to keep myself entertained. This ended up being a theme in my childhood.</p>
<p>One day, I thought I could make friends with the ants who had built a nest out in the open area far behind the house. I was fascinated by how they scurried back and forth, some appearing from the mound while others disappeared into it.</p>
<p>To make friends with them, it seemed I should get close and be down at their level. This meant I had to sit next to the mound. So I planted myself there on the ground, wearing my tan shorts, striped t-shirt and little red sneakers. When the first few ants crawled on me, I thought they were welcoming my invitation to be friends.</p>
<p>These were not your garden variety ants, mind you. They were those red and black kind that are nearly a quarter of an inch long with strong mandibles. These ants were big, fast, and as it turns out, very aggressive.</p>
<p>Before I knew it, I was covered with dozens of ants that saw me as a threat to their home. The hive sounded the alarm and went on the attack. First, I felt one bite, then a few more and several more soon after that. Before I knew it, my skin was on fire as the big red and black ants bit me over and over. They were all over me. No matter how hard I tried, I couldn‚Äôt get them all off my body. This was pain unlike any other in my short time on earth.</p>
<p>I got up from the ground in a panic and began stripping off my clothes as I ran toward the house screaming like a banshee. By the time I got to the back door, I was down to my underwear and little red sneakers, covered with big red welts. I ran upstairs where I found my mother nursing my half-sister. I‚Äôm sure the sight of her little boy bursting into the room practically naked with tears streaming down his face alarmed her.</p>
<p>She was able to calm me enough to get the story from me. She squished the few remaining ants she found in my hair, then broke out ointment to soothe the swollen bites. Her motherly attention dissolved my anxiety and I calmed down.</p>
<p>My mother and I reminisced about this many times over the years. We even talked about it the last time I saw her before she passed away. She always thought it was hilarious. I, however, remember it differently.</p>
<p>To this day, ants give me the heebie-jeebies ‚Äì even the tiny black ones you see after leaving greasy or sugary food out. If I find even one ant crawling on me after sitting in the grass, I‚Äôll start doing a very unmanly arm-flailing dance to get the critter off me as fast as I can.</p>
<p>I learned a big lesson that day‚Ä¶ Don‚Äôt sit on an ant mound without knowing the consequences, because you might get eaten alive. It was the last and only time I did.</p>

			 <p>Eventually you use up every excuse in your book for not doing the thing you keep saying you‚Äôre going to do. You‚Äôve procrastinated yourself into a corner and realize it‚Äôs either time to just do it, or finally forget about it and move on.</p>
<p>That‚Äôs me, sometimes‚Ä¶</p>
<p>I‚Äôve had this blog for nearly 14 years. In all that time, I only have 11 posts to show for it. That‚Äôs less than one post per year, with the newest one being more than a year old. At one point, I had written dozens of posts. But like any good artist is prone to doing, I trashed most of them because I felt like they were fodder. I regret making that choice.</p>
<p>I‚Äôve seriously slacked in my writing since, which is sad, because I‚Äôve always enjoyed the process. To me, putting words down, then moving them around to communicate an idea is fun. When I get into a flow, the words come out and land on the page. I don‚Äôt have to struggle with what I‚Äôm trying to say. They‚Äôre just there all of a sudden. When I tell a story through my writing, I feel like I‚Äôve created this thing that lives and breathes on its own.</p>
<p>To be truthful, I made a fatal mistake a few years back. Struggling to find my own voice, I began modeling my work after what other people were doing. However, since it wasn‚Äôt <!-- raw HTML omitted -->my<!-- raw HTML omitted --> voice, I began to believe what I had to say didn‚Äôt make a difference, so why should I even bother? This grew into the worst case of writer‚Äôs block there ever was in the history of man.</p>
<p>Well, probably not. I‚Äôm sure there have been worse cases by far better writers, but I became so utterly uninspired to write during the last five years that it literally hurt to even <!-- raw HTML omitted -->think<!-- raw HTML omitted --> about putting words down. The three posts I made in 2018 were not easy.</p>
<p>To make up for my lack of creativity, I found a great way to procrastinate ‚Äì tweaking my WordPress theme about a hundred-gazillion times. It became all-consuming to get things just pixel perfect and then start over from scratch again. I‚Äôve written and tweaked more CSS code than I‚Äôm willing to admit, though I have gotten pretty good at it. My site theme is practically everything I‚Äôve ever imagined in my head at this point. I can‚Äôt improve on it much more, if at all.</p>
<p>So what do I do now?</p>
<p>Just write.</p>
<p>Now is the time to stop procrastinating and make something. It doesn‚Äôt require perfection. My work will get better with practice. It doesn‚Äôt need to have meaning or impart some deep zen-like wisdom to the reader. I just need to start getting the stuff in my head out into written word.</p>
<p>Here and now is the best place for it, so this is where I‚Äôve decided to begin again.</p>
<p>What have you been putting off? Is now the time for you to start again too?</p>

			 <p>After nearly fifty years, I can still remember the first time I smoked a cigarette. It was early spring and my family lived on a farm in a semi-rural part of Colorado, a little north of Denver, at the foot of the Rocky Mountains.</p>
<p>I lived there with my mother, wicked step-father (I&rsquo;m not even sure they were married, to be honest) and little half-sister. The closest kid my age lived more than five miles away, so I had no one to play with. This meant I had to find ways to keep myself entertained. Most of them ended up being things little boys are not supposed to do. Left to my own devices, it&rsquo;s a wonder I lived through all of my escapades.</p>
<p>I was seven years old and had stolen a pack of my mom&rsquo;s Kool Menthol 100s. I had a pack of matches from somewhere (yes, I was a pyro too, but that&rsquo;s a post for another time) and thought I could smoke just like mom and wicked step-father did. After taking a pack from her carton in the refrigerator, I snuck outside and hid behind the juniper trees where I wouldn&rsquo;t be seen. I opened the pack, took the long cigarette out, put it between my lips, struck a match, lit up and took a big puff like I&rsquo;d seen the adults do.</p>
<p>Oddly enough, I wasn&rsquo;t repulsed by the taste. In fact, I actually liked it. I still remember the menthol sensation on my tongue. It had a little bit of burn to it, but the taste wasn&rsquo;t that bad. I felt very grown up.</p>
<p>Of course, my little boy brain didn&rsquo;t know you should inhale the smoke from a cigarette, which is probably good because I&rsquo;m sure if I had, I would have wound up puking my guts out behind the trees. Sometimes I wonder; if I had inhaled, would I have ended up picking up the habit nine years later, or would I have been turned off completely?</p>
<p>There were other experiments with smoking through my childhood, but none really stuck. I&rsquo;d smoke here and there and eventually lose interest.</p>
<p>Until the day I met Tracy. He had just moved into the neighborhood where my mother, step-sister and I were living (wicked step-father was long-gone now). I think he said he was from New York. He was my age but had already become a pack-a-day smoker. I vividly recall the summer evening he offered me a Marlboro Red from his hard pack box. You weren&rsquo;t cool if you smoked soft pack, you know. It had to be hard pack and it had to be Marlboro Reds.</p>
<p>I began taking him up on his offers of free cigarettes. Before I knew it, I was smoking every day, bumming cigarettes from friends whenever I could. Then the moment I knew I was hooked came: I wanted to smoke while I was alone.</p>
<p>My mother, being the spectacular parent she was, started buying my smokes for me, so I had a steady supply of my own stashed in the refrigerator. Her rationale was that she&rsquo;d rather I smoke openly instead of hiding it. I think she hoped I&rsquo;d come to hate the habit and give up. Well, thanks mom, that didn&rsquo;t quite work out as planned.</p>
<p>So at the tender age of sixteen, I became a confirmed pack-a-day smoker. All the other kids my age were doing it, so why not me too? The problem was, I really liked smoking. I knew I wasn&rsquo;t going to stop. Other kids did it to be cool. I did it to feed the nicotine addiction.</p>
<p>Twelve years went by, and then I met Pam.</p>
<p>I still see the moment from our very first date in my mind&rsquo;s eye. We were running across a busy street in downtown Santa Monica to get to the club where we were headed to see a band. In the middle of the street, the hard pack of Marlboro Lights fell to the ground from my shirt pocket with a loud <em>plop</em> sound. I bent down and picked them up. When we got to the sidewalk on the other side, she immediately told me &ldquo;<em>I don&rsquo;t date people who smoke.</em>&rdquo;</p>
<p>That was a punch to the face, but one I&rsquo;m glad I took. Naturally, I didn&rsquo;t light up on that date, or any other we had after that. We&rsquo;re still married 25 years later and she&rsquo;s my best friend. I made the choice to quit because of her and I&rsquo;m proud to say I haven&rsquo;t smoked a cigarette since before we were engaged.</p>
<p>I can remember a bunch of different cigarettes I smoked through my life, but thanks to someone who is very special to me, I can&rsquo;t remember the very last one. For that, I&rsquo;m forever grateful.</p>

			<h1><a href="https://jimmitchell.org/2017/04/13/eliminating-digital-distractions/">Eliminating Digital Distractions</a></h1>

			 <p>Life is so full of distractions. It seems everything is vying for our attention in one way or another these days, with most of it coming from our electronic gadgets.</p>
<p>If you take time to look up from your phone for a few minutes, you‚Äôll find a sea of humanity with faces buried in their own device. It‚Äôs painful to watch.</p>
<p>Personally, I‚Äôve come to a point where I‚Äôve had it with the digital distractions in my life, so this is what I‚Äôve done about it.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>There was a time I had more than four screens of apps on my iPhone. I know many people who have far more than that. I don‚Äôt know how they manage all those screens since I could barely cope with the number I had. I‚Äôd regularly forget where an app was, which would usually be somewhere on the third screen, beyond two other screens of mostly unused apps.</p>
<p>Though I wasn‚Äôt aware of it, I‚Äôd made a game out of shuffling apps around on my home screens, hoping to one day land on the perfect combination that made perfect sense and put the universe back in order. Honestly, I think most of the apps on my phone back then got moved around more often than they were ever used.</p>
<p>Once this dawned on me, I decided it was time to purge. The first order of business was to get rid of the useless time-wasting ‚Äúsocial‚Äù apps. I removed them from my phone without hesitation, deciding if I want to spend time on Facebook, I‚Äôll make time specifically for it. Now, I‚Äôm lucky if I look at the site more than three or four times a month. I don‚Äôt miss Facebook and could probably go without it entirely if I decided to. I only keep it around to stay in touch with extended family and old friends. I intentionally pared my ‚Äúfriend‚Äù list down to less than 50 people that I actually know too.</p>
<p>After nuking the useless apps, I started an experiment with the remaining by moving the ones I didn‚Äôt absolutely need to a ‚Äúfolder‚Äù on the second home screen. If I used an app more than a few times in a week, it got ‚Äúunpacked‚Äù and promoted back to the first home screen. After a month of this, I ended up with just 16 apps on my first screen ‚Äì including the four I‚Äôd left in the dock as ‚Äúmust-have‚Äù when I started.</p>
<p>For apps that I didn‚Äôt touch after two months, I completely removed them from the phone. I know if I ever need a particular app, I can download it again ‚Äî where it will find its rightful place on the second screen with all of the other lesser-used apps.</p>
<p>I evaluate my home screen every few weeks now to demote or remove apps if I feel they‚Äôre not serving a purpose. This has helped me stay laser-focused when I‚Äôm using my phone.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>For the apps I keep on my phone, if I need to see a notification of some kind, I‚Äôll set it to badge only. No sounds, vibrations, banners or alerts to distract me. I‚Äôll check it on my schedule, thank you very much.</p>
<p>This includes email ‚Äî both personal and work. I purposely decided I didn‚Äôt want up to the moment email notifications, and I‚Äôve found it quite liberating. Now, when I see a badge on an app, maybe I‚Äôll look at it, maybe I won‚Äôt. It pretty much depends on the number displayed on the badge whether I decide to act.</p>
<p>Of course, there are exceptions to this rule, but they are few. The Phone app obviously needs notifications ‚Äî otherwise, my phone isn‚Äôt a phone. Same for goes for Messages. I communicate with my immediate family by text a lot, so I leave this notification enabled.</p>
<p>The only other notifications I allow are OmniFocus for task management and Fantastical for calendars. I definitely need to be on time for meetings and appointments, and I must complete my tasks on time too.</p>
<p>Finally, I turned on ‚ÄúDo Not Disturb‚Äù mode between the hours of 10pm and 6am ‚Äî which is when I go to bed, and an hour after I get up. That first hour in the morning with no distractions helps me get focused on my day ahead.</p>
<p>If you‚Äôre a notification junkie like I was, it‚Äôs hard to get used to working this way. But if you give it some time, you‚Äôll find you‚Äôre picking your phone up a lot less and getting a lot more done during the day.</p>
<p>Give it a try. You‚Äôll feel less tethered to your phone, I promise.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>As a family, we‚Äôve agreed to set limits on when and where electronic devices are acceptable. Never, ever can any one of us bring a phone to the table during a meal. This rule extends to restaurant outings too. Once a meal is on the table, all gadgets go away until after the last person finishes their meal.</p>
<p>If we‚Äôre in a family setting for the holidays or a birthday, all devices get put away in pockets and purses so we can spend time socializing face-to-face. It‚Äôs okay if a phone comes out for a photo or two, but if any family member gets caught zoning out on their phone, everyone else reminds them of the rule. It‚Äôs worked pretty well so far.</p>
<p>These are some of the ways I‚Äôve started breaking the twitch to reach for my phone and check it. Sometimes I forget, but I find every day gets a little easier. If you‚Äôre looking to lessen your own digital distractions, give some of these a try yourself. You might find there‚Äôs a lot more going on around you than you realized.</p>

			 <p>Saying no can be one of the hardest things to do.</p>
<p>No to an exciting new project. No to a volunteer opportunity in the community or at church; no to the extra helping of food at a meal; no to bad habits we‚Äôve carried around with us all our lives.</p>
<p>There‚Äôs tremendous power in saying no. When we have the courage to do it, we stop stretching ourselves too thin. We make more time for our families. We become healthier by defeating the temptation to eat the extra cookie. We break bad habits that have held us captive all our lives.</p>
<p>These small wins add up over time and give us the courage to say no when we should more often.</p>
<p>It‚Äôs okay to say no. It doesn‚Äôt mean you‚Äôre weak. It says you‚Äôre strong and willing to sacrifice for the important stuff.</p>
<p>It takes guts to say no.</p>
<p>I‚Äôm working hard to learn this habit. No extra projects; no outside distractions and commitments that burn me out and take me away from the family; no to using food to deal with stress; no to procrastination; no wasting time on things that don‚Äôt matter.</p>
<p>I‚Äôve found it‚Äôs not easy. The temptation to give in is always there. I have to remind myself almost every day: ‚Äú<!-- raw HTML omitted -->Is this thing worth what it‚Äôs going to take away from something else?<!-- raw HTML omitted -->‚Äù</p>
<p>When I‚Äôm able to stay the course, I make room for plenty of yes in my life. Yes to spending time with family and friends; yes to being more focused and in the moment; yes to being mindful of those around me; yes to being tolerant of others; yes to making my health a priority.</p>
<p>It takes a lot of effort to say no. But in the end the good that comes from it far outweighs the bad we‚Äôre able to leave behind.</p>

			 <p>I‚Äôve been around long enough to know life moves in cycles.</p>
<p>Things that were new and exciting one day eventually become dull and boring the next. The pursuit of shiny objects and interesting paths quickly fall by the wayside before you realize it. We move from one thing to the next and then another in search of a quick thrill, because we‚Äôve become instant gratification junkies.</p>
<p>What if, instead, we intentionally slowed our lives down? What if we deliberately chose to look at the world in wonder like we did when we were young? What if we took time out to play like we did when we were children? What if we stopped to listen to what‚Äôs going on inside instead of burying our faces in smart devices that make us dumb?</p>
<p>We spend our adult lives working, chasing dreams, and running after material possessions we think will make us happy. But let me ask you; in all of your pursuits, are you truly content?</p>
<p>Is your soul really at peace?</p>
<p>If there‚Äôs any hint of hesitation in your answer, it might be time to step back, take a look at the bigger picture, and find what really fulfills you.</p>
<p>Your time on this pale blue dot is finite. It would be a tragic waste to get to the end and say ‚Äú<!-- raw HTML omitted -->I wish I could have‚Ä¶<!-- raw HTML omitted -->‚Äù Maybe today should be the day you stop spinning cycles on unnecessary things that don‚Äôt matter.</p>
<p>The choice is yours. It has been all along.</p>

		<a href="https://jimmitchell.org/2011/08/12/applescript-to-add-files-in/" class="u-url"><time class="dt-published" datetime="2011-08-12 17:24:46 -0800">Aug 12, 2011</time></a>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>Today I had the need to add a bunch of named text files to a folder in the Finder on my Mac.</p>
<p>I found it a major pain to open BBEdit, make a new document, save it to where I wanted it, and then manually copy &amp; rename the file back in the Finder. A lot of effort just to get 7 or 8 empty files with different names.</p>
<p>So, I threw together this little AppleScript to add empty files instead. The gist is once launched in the Finder (using <a href="http://www.red-sweater.com/fastscripts/">FastScripts</a> by <a href="http://www.red-sweater.com/">Red Sweater</a> naturally. Keystroke: cmd+option+shift+N), a dialog pops up that lets you enter a file title. Then the Finder creates that file in the front-most window. If no window is open, the file is added to your Desktop.</p>
<p>I found this to be more than twice as fast as the ‚Äútraditional‚Äù method of making several files. Hopefully, it can help you out too. Remember, use it with <a href="http://www.red-sweater.com/fastscripts/">FastScripts</a> for quick keystroke access. Save as a script in the ‚ÄúFinder‚Äù scripts folder <code>(‚Äú~/Library/Scripts/Applications/Finder/‚Äù)</code>.</p>
