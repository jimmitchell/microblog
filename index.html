			 <p>I&rsquo;ve been considering making a move from 1Password to a Bitwarden Enterprise subscription. Having been a 1P user for a <em>very</em> long time, I&rsquo;m hesitant about making a change, but would like to save the $18 a year. Someone talk me off the ledge &ndash; one way or the other&hellip;</p>

			 <p><a href="https://www.techspot.com/news/110735-over-21-youtube-now-ai-slop-report.html">More than 20% of YouTube&rsquo;s feed is now &ldquo;AI slop,&rdquo; report finds | TechSpot</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Not only are more than half the articles on the web created by AI, but over 21% of YouTube videos being shown to new users is &ldquo;AI Slop.&rdquo; That&rsquo;s according to a new report, which also found that the US is in third place when it comes to consumption of these low-quality generated videos.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I am not surprised by this. As a long-time YouTube viewer I’m seeing a good amount of AI slop myself. But this is what worries me most about the rise of AI; people and/or companies wanting to make a quick buck with <em>the least amount of effort possible</em> are going to increasingly generate low-quality content with AI-based tools…</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It&rsquo;s estimated that the Three Minutes Wisdom channel, which accounts for almost a quarter of the country&rsquo;s view count, earns around $4 million annually from ad income.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That&rsquo;s easy money&hellip;</p>
<p>I believe this will spill over into software development. I’m confident it already has. Companies that care more about the bottom line than they do bug-free applications will hire inexperienced developers to create enterprise apps using AI tools, leading to major security flaws.</p>
<p>I think we’ll start seeing more reports of data breaches as novice “developers” increasingly copy and paste AI-generated code without fully understanding what it does, much less vetting it for accuracy.</p>
<p>Lazy is as lazy does, and some developers I&rsquo;ve known over the years have been <em>very</em> lazy&hellip;</p>

			 <p>Usually, I&rsquo;ll leave the outside Christmas decor up until New Year&rsquo;s Day. It&rsquo;s been a tradition of my family since I was a kid. But since rain is forecast for SoCal from Wednesday through Sunday, I quickly took it all down yesterday. Surprisingly, I&rsquo;m a little sore because of it today.</p>

			 <p>To go along with a simpler approach to life in 2026, I created a new Micro.blog theme based on the <strong>mnml</strong> framework, stripping out a lot of the features I added over the last year. This one will remain for my personal use.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>As I look back on the lost year of 2025, I learned a lot about what&rsquo;s important to me; health, family, and close friends. This led me to give serious thought about what I want 2026 to look like now that I&rsquo;ve been given a new lease on life.</p>
<p>I want 2026 to be a year of renewal. Spending less time online and even more time present with those around me. Less time working crazy long hours and more time focused on my emotional, spiritual, mental, and physical well being. Less money spent on frivolous things and more time investing that money into the future.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://jimmitchell.org/2025/10/03/taking-a-break/">break</a> I took in October was liberating. I enjoyed not spending as much time online trying to be relevant in some way and just living a simple life, one day into the next.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;m shooting for in the coming year. No pressure to do or be anything for anyone outside of my close circle. If it goes as planned, you&rsquo;ll see less of me.</p>
<p>Why share this? No reason really. It&rsquo;s more for my own benefit than anything else. I wanted to memorialize the goal on my blog, since that&rsquo;s what a blog is supposed to be for. I feel I&rsquo;m at a point in my life where it&rsquo;s simply best to step back and slow down a little.</p>
<p>Thanks for reading. There will still be posts, but probably less noise.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s to a simpler 2026 for all of us.</p>

			 <p>Speaking of Kagi; I&rsquo;m a little late to the party, but I get it now. I didn&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;d have use for a paid search engine, but I think I&rsquo;m sold on it. The only challenge is being mindful of the number of searches per day. If I stick with it, funding for other online things will need to take a hit.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>You&rsquo;ve no doubt heard at some point in your life that failure is not an option. There are times this holds true; definitely when someone&rsquo;s life is on the line, or maybe &ndash; but only maybe &ndash; if there&rsquo;s a large sum of money at stake.</p>
<p>But I think there are times failure should be the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->only<!-- raw HTML omitted --> option.</p>
<p>Failure can be one of the best teachers we have &ndash; as long as we&rsquo;re willing to listen to her lessons.</p>
<p>Failure always shows us the truth. Sometimes gently, other times brutally.</p>
<p>We need to openly welcome failure&rsquo;s lessons into our lives in order to grow.</p>
<p>Failure will never lie to us. She shows us where we are wrong about our belief systems and how they may need to change.</p>
<p>If we&rsquo;re willing to fail in the most spectacular ways, failure will bless us with wisdom and humility in return.</p>
<p>But, if you think you have nothing to learn from failure and that you already have it all figured out, well then my friend, you&rsquo;ve already failed in the biggest way you possibly could.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>Old habits are sneaky little monkeys. They work every angle they know to quietly slip back into the circus of our lives without us noticing.</p>
<p>What they rely on most is us caving in to their idea of &ldquo;just this once&rdquo; a time or two in order to become the norm once again.</p>
<p>Before we know it, we find ourselves right back where we started.</p>
<p>We need to keep a watchful eye out for these conniving monkeys. When we feel the temptation to trade their convenience or comfort for the new and better habits we&rsquo;re trying to build, we need to get tough and say &ldquo;Bad monkey! It&rsquo;s not going to happen this time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Building new habits adds friction to our lives. It&rsquo;s easier to just &ldquo;go with the flow&rdquo; than it is to put in the extra work of sticking to our guns.</p>
<p>But if we do stick with them long enough, the friction eventually fades and the old monkey will have left our circus for good.</p>

<p>I understand limited-edition accessories and all, but seriously, $150 to $230 for a fancy knitted sock with a name attached to it?</p>
<p>Hmm&hellip; I don&rsquo;t think so.</p>

			 <p>It took a while to wrap things up, buy I&rsquo;m happy to finally share that a new version of <strong>mnml</strong> has been published for Micro.blog users that adds some cool features.</p>
<h2 id="html-image-classes">HTML Image Classes</h2>
<p>You now have better control over your html images using style classes, for example: <code>&lt;img class=&quot;align-left&quot; src=&quot;image.jpg&quot; /&gt;</code>.</p>
<p>They say a picture is worth a thousand words, so check out the <strong>mnml</strong> <a href="https://mnml.micro.blog/styleguide/#images-markdown-and-optional-html">style guide page</a> for more details and code examples you can copy right from the page.</p>
<h2 id="copy-code-blocks">Copy Code Blocks</h2>
<p>Speaking of copying code right from the page, this release also includes a setting you can enable to add a &ldquo;Copy&rdquo; button to your code blocks, letting readers easily copy a block of code to their clipboard for their own use.</p>
<p>Again, a picture is worth a thousand words, so try copying this code block for yourself:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-html" data-lang="html">&lt;<span style="color:#f92672">img</span> <span style="color:#a6e22e">class</span><span style="color:#f92672">=</span><span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;full-width&#34;</span> <span style="color:#a6e22e">src</span><span style="color:#f92672">=</span><span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;https://mnml.micro.blog/uploads/2025/pexels-simonmigaj-748898.jpg&#34;</span> <span style="color:#a6e22e">alt</span><span style="color:#f92672">=</span><span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;Three towering rock formations rise prominently amidst a landscape of rolling hills and a partly cloudy sky.&#34;</span>&gt;
</code></pre></div><p>Pretty cool, right?</p>
<p>This feature can be enabled with the &ldquo;<strong>Enable copy button for code blocks</strong>&rdquo; option in the <strong>mnml</strong> plugin settings page.</p>
<h2 id="thanks">Thanks&hellip;</h2>
<p>Thanks to everyone who has supported <strong>mnml&rsquo;s</strong> development over the <a href="https://jimmitchell.org/2024/10/27/so-at-the-urging-of/">last year</a>. It wouldn&rsquo;t have been possible without you.</p>

			 <p>I&rsquo;ve seen these floating around in the different feeds I read lately, like <a href="https://manuelmoreale.com/thoughts/10-pointless-facts-about-me">Manu&rsquo;s</a>, <a href="https://rsjon.es/2025/10/17/ten-pointless-facts-about-me/">Scott&rsquo;s</a>, and <a href="https://kevquirk.com/blog/ten-pointless-facts-about-me/">Kev&rsquo;s</a>.</p>
<p>Being one who has major fomo if I don&rsquo;t join the fun, I had to share my own pointless facts. However, being the one-ups-man I sometimes am, I chose to throw in a bonus fact eleven for your enjoyment.</p>
<h2 id="do-you-floss-your-teeth">Do you floss your teeth?</h2>
<p>Most of the time, but some days I&rsquo;m just plain lazy and will skip doing it. But then I&rsquo;ll feel guilty about that decision all day.</p>
<h2 id="tea-coffee-or-water">Tea, coffee, or water?</h2>
<p>This one&rsquo;s easy&hellip; Coffee. I love coffee. I can&rsquo;t get enough coffee. Sadly, I&rsquo;ve had to cut <em>way</em> back on it over the last two years. So it&rsquo;s two cups of &ldquo;regular&rdquo; coffee in the morning. If I drink any more through the day it&rsquo;s got to be decaf. The rest of the time it&rsquo;s water. Very rarely do I drink tea&hellip;like almost never.</p>
<h2 id="footwear-preference">Footwear preference?</h2>
<p>Running shoes, though I don&rsquo;t run. My current daily drivers are a pair of black Nike runners with a white swish that I just love. Once they wear out, they will be replaced by the same.</p>
<h2 id="favorite-dessert">Favorite dessert?</h2>
<p>Hands down, chocolate cake, but then I have a sweet tooth, so I will accept any dessert put in front of me. This too has been scaled <em>way</em> back over the last two years. For my sweet tooth fix these days it&rsquo;s an apple, Mandarin oranges, or a handful of blueberries.</p>
<h2 id="the-first-thing-you-do-when-you-wake-up">The first thing you do when you wake up?</h2>
<p>I swallow a pill for my damned under-active thyroid. Every. Single. Day. Then I get dressed and walk the dog. Then have coffee, which I&rsquo;ve been thinking of since the moment I woke up.</p>
<h2 id="age-youd-like-to-stick-at">Age you’d like to stick at?</h2>
<p>To me, 27 was my prime and was the age that being an adult just sort of clicked for me. I&rsquo;d love to be that age again, but still have the wisdom I&rsquo;ve gained over the last 34 years. I&rsquo;d rule the world.</p>
<h2 id="how-many-hats-do-you-own">How many hats do you own?</h2>
<p>Jeez. I don&rsquo;t even know. A quick guess would have to be ten, maybe 15. I&rsquo;ll get on a kick and buy a hat, wear it for a week and then it sits for months before I put it on again. I&rsquo;ve got a box of about five in the closet I haven&rsquo;t put on in nearly 10 years.</p>
<h2 id="describe-the-last-photo-you-took">Describe the last photo you took?</h2>
<p>A receipt for breakfast in the SFO airport when coming home from the Dreamforce conference last week. I take more photos of stuff like this than I do &ldquo;cool&rdquo; photos.</p>
<h2 id="worst-tv-show">Worst TV show?</h2>
<p>Keeping Up with the Kardashians, or Love After Lockup. Enough said. My wife enjoys both of them. I do not&hellip;at all.</p>
<h2 id="as-a-child-what-was-your-aspiration-for-adulthood">As a child, what was your aspiration for adulthood?</h2>
<p>I wanted to be a truck driver. Smokey and the Bandit was popular then. I thought it was so cool. I&rsquo;m glad it didn&rsquo;t work out that way though. I&rsquo;m really happy doing what I&rsquo;m doing now, even if it was all by accident.</p>
<h2 id="ubonus-factu-whats-the-scariest-dream-you-ever-had"><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Bonus fact<!-- raw HTML omitted -->: What&rsquo;s the scariest dream you ever had?</h2>
<p>As a kid of maybe five or six, I once had a dream that my Aunt and Uncle (who owned the family ranch that was <a href="https://jimmitchell.org/2025/08/10/so-sad-to-learn-today/">lost to fire</a> recently), had a collection of combs in a rack. They were all different types of combs, with one of them being made from bone. It had jagged teeth and looked scary. My aunt warned me to <strong>never</strong> use the bone comb.</p>
<p>I somehow managed to lose all the other combs in the rack until only the bone comb remained, so I had to use it one morning. When I took it from the rack, the comb &ndash; which turned out to be possessed &ndash; jumped out of my hand and began tearing up the sheets on the fold-out sofa bed I slept on when visiting them for the summer. That&rsquo;s all I can remember of it now.</p>
<p>That dream scared the shit out of me then, and I can still remember parts of it today. I&rsquo;m sure a child psychologist would have had a field day with that one since there was so much turmoil in my life back then.</p>
<h2 id="so-thats-uelevenu-pointless-facts-about-me">So that&rsquo;s <!-- raw HTML omitted -->eleven<!-- raw HTML omitted --> pointless facts about me&hellip;</h2>
<p>What are your answers to the 10 pointless fact questions? If you want to add fact number eleven, it has to be totally unique to you.</p>

			 <p>The first week back at work. It could have been much worse&hellip;</p>
<h2 id="monday">Monday</h2>
<p>My first day back was pretty low key. Tasks were mostly around getting access back to systems that were skipped in my reactivation.</p>
<p>The most important one missed was my building badge access. My set working hours are 7am to 4pm, which is an hour earlier than most. Fortunately, I was able to tailgate another departmental coworker in the door. We got this one fixed right away.</p>
<p>After the first hour of getting situated, there were the first two standing meetings. Lots of &ldquo;we missed you&rdquo; and &ldquo;glad to have you back&rdquo; sentiments from everyone. It was nice, but also kind of embarrassing at the same time.</p>
<p>From there, the rest of my calendar was free. This gave me the time to go through 13 weeks of email to separate the irrelevant from the important. There were thousands of messages, with 60% falling in the irrelevant (and deleted items) bucket.</p>
<p>Then came lunch. Before my leave, I was an eat lunch at the desk type who continued to work while I ate. I made a pact with myself that I wasn&rsquo;t going to do that anymore, so I got up, went outside and took a brisk mile and a half walk. Then I came back and ate in the employee lounge, reading a book and turning off work for 30 minutes.</p>
<p>After lunch, it was back to sorting through the remaining emails and catching up on Slack threads. All through the day, people were dropping by with welcome back wishes.</p>
<p>When 4pm rolled around, I packed up and headed home right on time. In the past, I&rsquo;ve been a &ldquo;one or two more hours&rdquo; type, but not anymore. The work will still be there tomorrow.</p>
<h2 id="tuesday">Tuesday</h2>
<p>This was a very full day of meetings, most of which I had scheduled with different teams to get debriefed on everything that happened. I purposely scheduled them individually to be sure I got the same story from each group &ndash; which I pretty much did.</p>
<p>All in all, what went down was not earth shaking and my direct reports handled it well. Kudos to them. I feel more confident that I won&rsquo;t have to be the one to save the world anymore.</p>
<p>The last debrief was with my manager. He promised me he wasn&rsquo;t going to overwhelm me with topics, but naturally he kept adding &ldquo;one more thing&rdquo; to the list, which kept me around until 5pm. He also assigned me a critical project to be worked on.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re back, baby&hellip;</p>
<p>Sticking around until five, I&rsquo;d forgotten how bad traffic can get. In true SoCal fashion, it took me an hour to drive 18 miles home. I was tired when I pulled in the driveway.</p>
<h2 id="wednesday">Wednesday</h2>
<p>Today was all about catching up on training. There were several hours of it. I somehow managed not to fall asleep.</p>
<p>Wednesdays are employee breakfast day. Today was breakfast croissant sandwiches. I&rsquo;m too scared of eating bacon and sausage now, so I took the vegetarian option. It was enjoyable, but there&rsquo;s something about bacon on a treat like this that just hits different&hellip;</p>
<p>There were more team meeting sprinkled throughout. The &ldquo;welcome backs&rdquo; were getting more infrequent by today.</p>
<p>Traffic home was as bad as the day before.</p>
<h2 id="thursday">Thursday</h2>
<p>It was hard to get going this morning.</p>
<p>Today was practically all meetings. I had a couple of hours to work on the high priority project, but the rest were with key vendors. These meetings can be a slog.</p>
<p>A whole new wave of &ldquo;welcome back&rdquo; and &ldquo;we missed you&rdquo; sentiments from them. Yeah, yeah&hellip; Thanks.</p>
<p>I was able to maintain my new lunch habit of a 30-minute brisk walk followed by eating in the employee lounge all the way through the week so far. I&rsquo;m pretty proud of myself.</p>
<p>I got out of the office on time, but traffic was again bad today too. Thursdays are the worst evening commute day in SoCal.</p>
<p>By the time I got home, I was wiped out and went to bed an hour earlier than normal.</p>
<h2 id="friday">Friday</h2>
<p>I&rsquo;ve made it through the week. Still tired, but I think I&rsquo;ll make it.</p>
<p>A couple of standing meetings in the morning, and a full two hours uninterrupted to work on the project. It was awesome.</p>
<p>Then lunch. I made it the entire week without eating at my desk. Woo! But, being as tired as I was, I skipped the brisk walk. I felt guilty for making this decision, but the body needs rest sometimes too, right?</p>
<p>After lunch, it was a monthly call with my friend &amp; mentor, Matt. We talked about the week, my plans for next week at the Dreamforce conference and just how I was feeling overall. It&rsquo;s always great to catch up with him. Matt is the real deal.</p>
<p>The final meeting of the day was with my team to coordinate our arrivals at the conference on Monday. We&rsquo;re a distributed team, so we&rsquo;re coming in on different flights.</p>
<p>After working all of that out, I did a little more work on the project that I&rsquo;d planned to leave until after my return from Dreamforce. This will put us a week ahead of schedule. I felt accomplished by it.</p>
<p>Finally, with everything pretty well wrapped up, I left the office at 3pm. Traffic did not suck at this time.</p>
<p>All in all, it was a good first week back and I feel strong. I&rsquo;m glad I had it to get ready for next week. It will be full of walking, sessions and meetings with vendors we work with.</p>

			 <p>I had a great email conversation with Manu the other day where we talked about the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->digital fatigue<!-- raw HTML omitted --> he&rsquo;s been feeling lately. His approach to overcoming it was pretty radical, much more so than I think I&rsquo;m ready for.</p>
<p>But if I&rsquo;m honest, I too am feeling my own digital burnout after consuming it non-stop for the last few months while trying to fill my days doing so little during my recovery.</p>
<p>So, I&rsquo;m going to try my own experiment.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve removed all the apps from my phone and tablet that I tend to fall into when I get bored. The only place I intend to engage with online content is from my personal computer in the evenings or early morning. Sort of a daily digital catch up if you will.</p>
<p>My goal is to limit the amount of time I spend online for personal consumption to an hour <!-- raw HTML omitted -->at the very most<!-- raw HTML omitted --> each day for the rest of October, including weekends.</p>
<p>It means you might not see much of me for the rest of the month, but I will always be available through <!-- raw HTML omitted -->email<!-- raw HTML omitted --> if you wanted to get in touch about something.</p>

<p>But, I feel the need for something new.</p>
<p>As awesome as Micro.blog is &ndash; and like I said, it really, <em>really</em> is &ndash; I don&rsquo;t have total control over my site using someone else&rsquo;s semi-closed platform. Since I&rsquo;m a certified type A control freak, the aspect of being <em>completely</em> hands-on is important to me.</p>
<p>Because of this, I chose to move my apex domain to a <a href="https://gohugo.io/">Hugo</a> static generated site hosted on <a href="https://pages.cloudflare.com/">Cloudflare pages</a><sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>. This lets me tweak my workflow so my content gets output <em>exactly</em> the way I want it, and it lets me leverage a robust global infrastructure to serve it all up.</p>
<p>You may be asking &ldquo;<em>What about Micro.blog, Jim? Are you leaving?</em>&rdquo;</p>
<p>No&hellip; I have no plans to leave Micro.blog whatsoever. The community there is wonderful and Manton is a top-notch aces kind of guy. My plan is to move my Micro.blog presence to a sub-domain (<a href="https://micro.jimmitchell.org">micro.jimmitchell.org</a>) where I can continue to share my thoughts, links, photos and the occasional full post.</p>
<p>And yes, <strong><a href="https://github.com/jimmitchell/mnml/">mnml</a></strong> will continue to get the same amount of love it always has.</p>
<p>The plan for this site is to write long form posts, along with code examples and other technical tutorials like I did before I moved to Micro.blog.</p>
<p>As always, thanks for your readership and support. It means a lot to me. Send me an <a href="mailto:hello@jimmitchell.org">email</a> if you have questions about my decision, or reach out on <a href="https://indieweb.social/@jimmitchell">Mastodon</a> if you&rsquo;d like to discuss it publicly.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>My sixty-first birthday passed by a couple of weeks ago. I purposely kept it quiet. There&rsquo;s no need for belated wishes, though I will graciously acknowledge them if given.</p>
<p>Sixty was an interesting year in that it <em>kind</em> of felt like I was still in my fifties, having not lived a full year as a sexagenarian. But sixty-one hits a little different. To me, it&rsquo;s when the world begins seeing people as old.</p>
<p>In my mind, I&rsquo;m the same age I started seeing my grandparents whither, with hands full of arthritis, bent postures, and gray hair. Thankfully, I only have the gray hair at this point.</p>
<p>Even still, sixty was one <em>hell</em> of a year for me health-wise, which has brought a lot of things into sharp focus.</p>
<p>If I&rsquo;m lucky, I have somewhere between six to nine years left working at my current job. I&rsquo;ve been working full time since I was fourteen. I&rsquo;ve always taken pride in the work I did, and it&rsquo;s always been a big part of who I was.</p>
<p>Even when it&rsquo;s been a grind, I&rsquo;ve absolutely loved working in the field I was fortunate enough to land in by pure accident. I&rsquo;m proud of what I&rsquo;ve been able to create over the years that made the lives of others simpler and more efficient.</p>
<p>But, I&rsquo;m at a crossroads now&hellip;</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m about to be the one who&rsquo;s no longer leading the charge. It&rsquo;s time that I start stepping aside for those who were meant to come after me, so they can make their own difference.</p>
<p>To accomplish this, I see myself moving into a place of sharing the wisdom gained during the 45+ years I&rsquo;ve been working with those at the front lines now; teaching them what worked for me and what didn&rsquo;t. Sharing regrets and what I&rsquo;ve learned from them. Or, how I might handle some of those regrets differently given a second chance.</p>
<p>This post may sound like I&rsquo;m defeated. Make no mistake; I&rsquo;m not even close to calling it quits. I feel stronger, bolder, and more excited for life than ever.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s clear where my focus needs to be once I return to work. Instead of expecting others to hold my beer while I save the world, it&rsquo;s my place to hold <em>their</em> beer and encourage <em>them</em> to step up and become the superheroes they were meant to be.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m excited for this transition. Done right, it&rsquo;ll be a legacy of sorts, and I will have left my mark on the next generation of knowledge worker superheroes.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>At the behest of <a href="https://micro.blog/josephaleo">@josephaleo</a> yesterday evening, I took the time today to add a new &ldquo;featured&rdquo; or &ldquo;pinned&rdquo; post feature to my <strong>mnml</strong> theme for Micro.blog.</p>
<p>You can update to v2.7.1 in your Micro.blog plugins area soon if not already.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s how the feature works&hellip;</p>
<p>Say you have a category you always want the latest post to stay pinned to the top of your home page for, no matter how many other posts in different categories you may publish. It might &ndash; well, does &ndash; look something like this&hellip;</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>After updating to version 2.7.1, all you have to do is set your preferred category name in the new <strong>mnml</strong> theme setting, like this&hellip;</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>In this example on my sandbox site, the latest post in my &ldquo;Featured Post&rdquo; category stays pinned on the home page, no matter what. When I publish a new post in the &ldquo;Featured Post&rdquo; category, it then becomes the pinned post at the top of the home page.</p>
<p>The category can be anything you choose. In the case of <a href="https://micro.blog/josephaleo">@josephaleo</a>, he wants to pin the latest &ldquo;<a href="https://watchtowerintel.com/categories/podcast/">Podcast</a>&rdquo; category post on his home page to feature his latest episode.</p>
<p>If you like this enhancement, or would like to simply support <strong>mnml</strong>&rsquo;s continued development in general, <a href="https://www.buymeacoffee.com/jim.mitchell">buying me a coffee</a> is always a pleasant surprise.</p>

			 <p>So&hellip; In case you were wondering, yes, I&rsquo;m still here, alive and kicking. 😁</p>
<p>If you weren&rsquo;t aware, I&rsquo;ve been recuperating from a quadruple <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/coronary-bypass-surgery/about/pac-20384589">CABG</a> (Coronary Artery Bypass Grafting for those not in the &ldquo;club&rdquo;). I&rsquo;m happy to report my cardiologist has given me a clean bill of health. Apart from a little leg swelling and the occasional pain in my sternum, I feel great and am back to pre-surgery activities.</p>
<p>If there were one piece of advice I think might help someone else going through what I went through, it would have to be that attitude makes all the difference.</p>
<p>Even on my worst days, I forced myself to maintain a positive outlook. It could have been easy to get depressed sitting around doing nothing &ndash; and I almost did a couple of times. But I kicked my own ass out of it, reminding myself that taking it easy to recover was important and to learn from the process.</p>
<p>Anyway&hellip; Enough of that. I went through it and came out aces on the other side. I&rsquo;m grateful for each day&rsquo;s dawn. I see things differently now and plan to write a post on that before long.</p>
<p>What I really wanted to share was that I felt good enough today to create that <strong>mnml</strong> <a href="https://micro.blog/account/plugins/view/169">archives by year plugin</a> I promised a <a href="https://micro.jimmitchell.org/2025/07/22/if-youre-a-mnml-user/">little bit ago</a>. If you have a long page of archives, this could help you. Install it from the Micro.blog plugins directory.</p>
<p>I also took some time to make some tweaks to the <strong>mnml</strong> theme itself. Taking inspiration from <a href="https://micro.blog/manton">@manton</a>&rsquo;s <a href="https://www.manton.org/2025/08/03/created-a-new-plugin-photos.html">Photos with months</a> plugin, I updated <strong>mnml</strong> to simply default to grouping images by month/year for both the grid and masonry layouts. It looks pretty awesome if I do say so myself. The new version is 2.6.0 and you should be able to update soon if not already.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s it. Time for this guy to get out and enjoy the day. My wife and I are going to visit Seal Beach this afternoon. Maybe I&rsquo;ll snap some pics from our outing.</p>
<p>✌🏻❤️‍🩹</p>

			 <p>Week three post-surgery check up went well. Cardiologist is pleased with my recovery, but admonished me to &ldquo;slow your roll, dude.&rdquo; I guess walking two or three miles a day is considered a little excessive at this point, even if I feel good.</p>

			 <p>Robert Birming (<a href="https://micro.blog/birming">@birming</a>) called me out to respond to his inaugural <a href="https://birming.com/2025/06/21/microblog-question-challenge/">Micro.blog Question Challenge</a> yesterday. How could I say no to such an interesting way to share a little about myself?</p>
<p>As is customary after posting my own, I&rsquo;m extending the challenge to Numeric Citizen (<a href="https://micro.blog/numericcitizen">@numericcitizen</a>) and David Johnson (<a href="https://micro.blog/crossingthethreshold">@crossingthethreshold</a>) to answer the same questions:</p>
<ol>
<li>Why did you start a blog in the first place?</li>
<li>Have you blogged on other platforms before?</li>
<li>Why did you choose Micro.blog?</li>
<li>Do you write your posts directly in the editor or in another application?</li>
<li>When do you feel most inspired to write?</li>
<li>Do you publish immediately after writing or do you let it simmer a bit as a draft?</li>
<li>What&rsquo;s your favorite post on your blog?</li>
<li>Any future plans for your blog?</li>
</ol>
<p>You don&rsquo;t need to be called out to join in on the fun. Let Robert know by mentioning him on the Micro.blog timeline if you publish answers of your own.</p>
<p>Without further ado, here are my responses&hellip;</p>
<h2 id="why-did-you-start-a-blog-in-the-first-place">Why did you start a blog in the first place?</h2>
<p>I started publishing online in the early 2000&rsquo;s as a place to share updates about the Mac app I was developing named &ldquo;<a href="https://jimmitchell.org/yasu/">Yasu</a>&rdquo; &ndash; which was short for &ldquo;Yet another system utility.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was a Mac system maintenance utility written AppleScript Studio that performed the important system maintenance tasks Mac OS needed at the time.</p>
<p>I created it mostly because Cocktail, which I was using then, decided to move to a shareware model. I thought I could write a Mac app myself. How hard could it be? The very first version was <em>really</em> ugly, but it worked. That became a journey lasting more than 17 awesome years.</p>
<p>Yasu opened a lot of doors for me. It had write ups in most of the big Apple magazines of the day, and it got me invites to speak at a couple of small Mac conferences and a handful of local user groups.</p>
<p>Developing Yasu were some of the best years of my life. Blogging about the journey went hand in hand with it. I met a lot of super-awesome people I still keep in touch with today because of Yasu.</p>
<h2 id="have-you-blogged-on-other-platforms-before">Have you blogged on other platforms before?</h2>
<p>I&rsquo;ve tried nearly every major blogging platform at one time or another.</p>
<p>I started with Blogspot (Blogger), but didn&rsquo;t publish much there. I tried MovableType, Tumblr, Drupal, and some others I can&rsquo;t remember the name of anymore. I even tried Jekyll as a static site generator, and just doing my site 100% by hand.</p>
<p>Ultimately, I landed on WordPress in 2004 and stuck with it for most of my time publishing online.</p>
<p>When Ghost came around, I gave it a short spin, migrating all my WordPress content to it. That move lasted all of two months. In the end, it didn&rsquo;t resonate with my workflow, so went back to WordPress.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve used cheap as dirt shared hosting plans, run my own VPS &ndash; learning a LOT about Linux &ndash; and even served my WordPress site from a salvaged Bondi Blue iMac tucked under my desk in the early years.</p>
<h2 id="why-did-you-choose-microblog">Why did you choose Micro.blog?</h2>
<p>I first heard about Micro.blog from John Gruber on <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2017/01/24/reece-micro-blog">Daring Fireball</a> in 2017. I thought it was a cool idea and filed it away mentally. I was still happy with WordPress, so didn&rsquo;t make the move then.</p>
<p>But, as WordPress became overly complex with features I didn&rsquo;t want or need, I started considering other solutions. That&rsquo;s when I really looked at Micro.blog &ndash; around three years ago.</p>
<p>I first migrated my WordPress site to Micro.blog in March 2023. But after 20 years on WordPress, I felt lost and moved back. However, I returned in May of the same year, and have been here ever since.</p>
<p>I chose Micro.blog for its simplicity. It was nice not to have to run a server of my own. The feature set is simple, making it easy to get my thoughts and ideas published.</p>
<p>But, the reason I stuck with the platform was the community.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve become acquainted with many <em>really</em> cool people through Micro.blog. The community here is one of the big reasons I began giving back by developing plugins and my <strong>mnml</strong> theme.</p>
<p>I follow some really interesting people who inspire me by what they share. I completely grok Manton&rsquo;s vision for Micro.blog now. I&rsquo;m 100% in on the platform, Fediverse and all.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t have plans to go anywhere else.</p>
<h2 id="do-you-write-your-posts-directly-in-the-editor-or-in-another-application">Do you write your posts directly in the editor or in another application?</h2>
<p>I don&rsquo;t have a single place I always write from.</p>
<p>For short &ldquo;thought&rdquo; posts without a title, I mostly fire them off using the iOS app, but I&rsquo;ll also write them from the web interface if that&rsquo;s where I&rsquo;m at, or the Micro.blog macOS app if I&rsquo;m using it at the moment.</p>
<p>I sometimes use Greg Morris' (<a href="https://micro.blog/gregmorris">@gregmorris</a>) Micro Social iOS app too. <a href="https://microsocial.micro.blog/">Micro Social</a> is a pretty rad app and I&rsquo;m excited to see it mature.</p>
<p>For longer blog posts like this one, I exclusively use <a href="https://redsweater.com/marsedit/">MarsEdit</a> by Daniel Jalkut (<a href="https://micro.blog/danielpunkass">@danilepunkass</a>). I&rsquo;ve been using MarsEdit since 2007 because it paired so nicely with WordPress. When I came to Micro.blog I was stoked to find the app worked here too. That helped my decision to move.</p>
<h2 id="when-do-you-feel-most-inspired-to-write">When do you feel most inspired to write?</h2>
<p>Inspiration can hit me at any time. Usually it&rsquo;s after I&rsquo;ve read something that resonated with me, I&rsquo;ve learned something new, or just have an idea I think others might be interested in.</p>
<p>For the &ldquo;deep thinking&rdquo; posts, I&rsquo;ll ruminate on a subject for a few days before writing a single word, drafting and rewriting the post over and over in my head. This helps me get thoughts in order and research a topic if I need to.</p>
<h2 id="do-you-publish-immediately-after-writing-or-do-you-let-it-simmer-a-bit-as-a-draft">Do you publish immediately after writing or do you let it simmer a bit as a draft?</h2>
<p>For most long posts, I pretty much publish right away.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll write the first draft fast, getting my thoughts down as they flow out of my brain.</p>
<p>Then I&rsquo;ll go back to the top of what I wrote and begin editing, trying to make thoughts clear and fix grammar. Once the first edit is complete, I&rsquo;ll preview the post in MarsEdit over and over to be sure it reads well. When I come across something I think is hard to follow, I&rsquo;ll work on it.</p>
<p>Once I&rsquo;m happy with what I&rsquo;ve written, I hit publish and walk away.</p>
<p>After an hour &ndash; or even days &ndash; I&rsquo;ll go back and re-read the post on my site as if I were a visitor. Four out of five times I find something I wrote still doesn&rsquo;t communicate the idea I wanted it to, so I&rsquo;ll go back into MarsEdit, make edits and republish.</p>
<p>These post-publish tweaks can happen a few times. I&rsquo;ve even gone back and edited posts from years ago after re-reading them.</p>
<p>My short social media-like &ldquo;thought&rdquo; posts are rapid fire. I just write them and post. It&rsquo;s what came to my mind right then, and once it&rsquo;s out there, that&rsquo;s what it is. I&rsquo;ll only edit it if grammar makes me sound like a moron &ndash; so yeah, those get edited more often than I would like.</p>
<h2 id="whats-your-favorite-post-on-your-blog">What&rsquo;s your favorite post on your blog?</h2>
<p>I don&rsquo;t have many posts on my site. In 2014 I went through a tough time emotionally and creatively, deleting nearly everything I&rsquo;d ever written except the ones I liked or saw were getting regular traffic.</p>
<p>One of the posts I chose to keep is titled &ldquo;<em><a href="https://jimmitchell.org/2018/04/28/memorable-cigarettes/">Memorable Cigarettes</a></em>.&rdquo; It&rsquo;s the first post I wrote that gives a glimpse into my childhood, ultimately leading to meeting my wife, and making the right choice to stop smoking because I was so smitten with her.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d have to say that one is my favorite post. &ldquo;<em><a href="https://jimmitchell.org/2024/07/22/a-bicycle-and-barbed-wire/">A Bicycle and Barbed Wire</a>,&quot;</em> which is another glimpse into my childhood, is my second favorite.</p>
<h2 id="any-future-plans-for-your-blog">Any future plans for your blog?</h2>
<p>I&rsquo;m pretty happy with my blog as it is. I like using it to post short thoughts and interact with other Micro.blog and Fediverse folk.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d like to start writing longer, more deeply contemplated posts. I have a lot of interesting stories from my life to tell. They should make for good entertainment. I think it&rsquo;s time they see the light of day.</p>
<p>I might start doing short podcast (I call them &ldquo;microcast&rdquo;) episodes every now and then. People have always told me I have a great radio voice. We&rsquo;ll see about that.</p>

<p>Jamie Thingelstad (<a href="https://micro.blog/jthingelstad">@jthingelstad</a>) posted a great analogy about the IndieWeb <a href="https://www.thingelstad.com/2025/06/19/indieweb-is-punk.html">over on his site today</a>, likening it to the quintessence of what makes Punk Rock special to so many&hellip;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>As Punk Rock was to the music industry of that era, is the IndieWeb bringing the same ethos to the Web of today — minus the mohawks?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As someone who grew up on the Punk of the &rsquo;80s, I totally relate to where he&rsquo;s coming from. To me the IndieWeb is a community of gifted misfits, doing it their own way with the tools they have, and without the need for big tech (the establishment), just like Punk is.</p>
<p>I think Jamie sums it up the best though&hellip;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We don’t need major platforms. We have the Web, keyboards, tools, and community. IndieWeb is Punk! Is it time to bring the Mohawks back?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Yeah, Jamie, I say we bring the Mohawks back. Oi!</p>
<p>In the comment thread, Robert Birming (<a href="https://micro.blog/birming">@birming</a>) had the brilliant idea of making Jamie&rsquo;s rallying cry into a t-shirt.</p>
<p>Always one to answer a call when there&rsquo;s a need, I hereby present you with the official &ldquo;IndieWeb is Punk&rdquo; t-shirts, available through Cotton Bureau, available in <a href="https://cottonbureau.com/p/ZX5246/shirt/indieweb-is-punk-black">black</a> or <a href="https://cottonbureau.com/p/SUB4NV/shirt/indieweb-is-punk-white">white</a> designs.</p>
<p>Any and all proceeds ($2 a shirt) will be donated directly to the <a href="https://www.eff.org/">Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF)</a>, the leading nonprofit defending digital privacy, free speech, and innovation for 35 years and counting.</p>

			 <p>As I shared a week or so ago, I underwent an angiogram that found some really bad stuff and will require open heart bypass surgery in a week and a half.</p>
<p>Yes, I&rsquo;m a little scared. But I won&rsquo;t bore you any further with that one. It&rsquo;s going to be a gnarly ride. I know I&rsquo;ll come out aces on the other side.</p>
<p>Or&hellip; (cue morbid humor) I won&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>Anyway. To add insult to injury, imagine my joy to learn as part of a post-procedure ultrasound of my neck that &ldquo;significant narrowing&rdquo; of my right carotid artery was also found.</p>
<p>Yay me!</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s right, one of the two arteries that supplies blood to my brain is pretty narrowed. Thankfully the left one is still in good shape, otherwise we&rsquo;d have a big problem.</p>
<p>What does it mean?</p>
<p>Well, it means that just as I&rsquo;m getting back on my feet, I get to go under the knife <em>yet again</em> to take care of this little inconvenience. Thankfully, the recovery is not too hard from what I&rsquo;ve read and I should be good to go soon after.</p>
<p>Let this be a lesson kids&hellip; Take care of yourself early in life. Eat the good stuff. Avoid the burgers and fries. Don&rsquo;t do like I did. It&rsquo;ll catch up to you and bite you if you do.</p>
<p>Man, this aging thing is beginning to suck just a little&hellip;</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>I had a really meaningful chat with my mentor yesterday about asking for help during my upcoming surgery and recovery. It made me realize something important…</p>
<p>I’m one of those super independent types who hate asking for help. I’d rather tough it out and struggle than admit I need support. This comes from how I grew up. My mom, a single mom, worked long hours to make sure I and my step-sister had everything we needed. I had to do a lot for myself as a kid and figure out how to get by.</p>
<p>Matt (my mentor) and I talked about how letting people help us out will make them feel good about themselves. Even a small task can make a big difference when someone feels helpless.</p>
<p>Matt shared how after his own recent surgery, he let a friend move some clothes in bins from an upstairs bedroom to the garage for him. It was a simple task, but it meant a lot to his friend. Matt wanted to help, but he realized that letting his friend do it would make a difference in both of their lives.</p>
<p>Relying on others helps us realize that we’re important to others too. I’ve gotten so many offers of help from people I never thought I’d get it from. It’s made me realize that I’ve had a bigger impact on others than I thought. It really makes me emotional every time I experience it.</p>
<p>There’s a lot of selfish stuff going on these days, and it’s only going to get worse before it gets better. But in the end, we’re all in this together. We don’t need to feel ashamed when we ask for help. And we need to be ready to help those who need it when we can.</p>
<p>So the next time someone asks what they can do for me, I’m going to think of something for them to do, no matter how small. I’m blessed to have the support system I have — and never realized was there.</p>

			 <p>As <a href="https://micro.jimmitchell.org/2025/06/05/really-bad-news-from-my/">I&rsquo;ve already shared</a>, I&rsquo;m facing the <em>very</em> gnarly reality of open-heart surgery within the next few weeks &ndash; maybe sooner.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s how I got here&hellip;</p>
<p>Towards the end of the pandemic, my Apple Watch notified me that my average resting heart rate had significantly dropped over the course of a few months, from the low seventies down to the mid-forties.</p>
<p>This surprised me.</p>
<p>I went to my GP about it, but he didn&rsquo;t seem to think it was serious enough to investigate, so nothing was done. I noticed I was more tired than usual, but I&rsquo;ve been seeing him for 25 years, so I trusted his judgement.</p>
<p>I may need to reconsider my primary care physician, but that&rsquo;s for another time.</p>
<p>About a year and a half ago came &ldquo;<a href="https://jimmitchell.org/2024/03/06/on-the-fragility-of-life/">the event</a>&rdquo; as I&rsquo;ve come to call it. I woke up to uncontrolled A-fib at 4am on a Thursday morning. It was serious enough to <em>make</em> me want to go to the hospital, which is unheard of. Thankfully, my Apple Watch let me know about this one and is the reason I went to the hospital.</p>
<p>You can read about that one on its own.</p>
<p>I endured the usual poking and prodding after: A stress test, EKGs, blood tests, and whatnot. Nothing bad was found. I will say that I&rsquo;m lucky to have been referred to a really good cardiologist as part of it though.</p>
<p>Over the course of the last year and a half, I cleaned up my lifestyle, got on the right meds, and managed to shed nearly 60 pounds, putting me back at the weight I was when I met my wife 32 years ago. I felt better than ever and was happy to be fit again.</p>
<p>Then about a month ago came the night I woke up to chest pain. I thought it was a cramp from sleeping wrong. Then came the same pain when I exerted myself. This told me something wasn&rsquo;t right. Before I could get in with my cardiologist, I had more A-fib events which I was able to capture on my watch.</p>
<p>I took the first appointment I could to see one of the other doctors in my cardiology group since my regular doctor was booked. She recommended a CTA, or <a href="https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/health/treatment-tests-and-therapies/computed-tomography-angiography-cta">computed tomography angiography</a>. The results of the scan were concerning enough to warrant a full-on invasive <a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diagnostics/4977-angiography">angiogram</a> a couple weeks later.</p>
<p>I had that procedure late last week. My wife and I hoped a couple of stents could be placed and I&rsquo;d be right as rain again.</p>
<p>That wasn&rsquo;t meant to be.</p>
<p>Instead, my cardiologist found I&rsquo;m on the verge of a <a href="https://www.webmd.com/heart-disease/widow-maker-heart-attack">widow-maker heart attack</a> with multiple blockages of 80% or more. Stents couldn&rsquo;t fix this one.</p>
<p>Damn. That is some really serious shit right there&hellip;</p>
<p>That catches us up to today.</p>
<p>I have an appointment with a thoracic surgeon on Wednesday. I already know what&rsquo;s going to come of it &ndash; open heart bypass surgery. The only thing I don&rsquo;t know is how quickly it&rsquo;s going to happen. It could be a couple of weeks, or it could be a couple of days.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve got to get a lot of things in order quickly.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve never faced anything remotely like this in my life. I&rsquo;m kind of scared by it, and I&rsquo;m still trying to grasp what&rsquo;s about to happen. It&rsquo;s going to be intense and life changing. But, I know I can pull through it, and I know it&rsquo;s for God&rsquo;s purpose.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;ve read this, I appreciate you taking the time. I&rsquo;m usually pretty private about things like this, but I needed to get it written and published so the story can be continued later.</p>
<p>I also appreciate the great encouragement I&rsquo;ve already received. Thanks to all of you (so many already) who have shared something. It means more than I can say.</p>
<p>To be continued&hellip;</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>I&rsquo;m happy to share that a new <strong>mnml</strong> update is on the way. This release (v2.5.7) adds the following new features&hellip;</p>
<ul>
<li>The ability to toggle a &ldquo;Subscribe via RSS&rdquo; link in the theme footer for those on Micro.one who don&rsquo;t have the customizable footer option that Micro.blog does.</li>
<li>The ability to toggle a &ldquo;read time&rdquo; for posts with a title. This applies to any post with a title for the time being.</li>
<li>Adds a copyright year range for blogs that have posts published before the current year. E.g., if your blog only has posts for the current year, it will display just the current year (© 2025). If it has several years of published posts, you&rsquo;ll see a year range (© 2008 &ndash; 2025).</li>
</ul>
<p>You should see v2.5.7 available in your Micro.blog plugins list soon if it&rsquo;s not there already.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re a <strong>mnml</strong> user, thanks for your support!</p>

			<h1><a href="https://jimmitchell.org/2025/05/26/using-phosphor-icons-for-microblog/">Using Phosphor Icons for Micro.blog Navigation</a></h1>
		

		<a href="https://jimmitchell.org/2025/05/26/using-phosphor-icons-for-microblog/" class="u-url"><time class="dt-published" datetime="2025-05-26 10:24:11 -0800">May 26, 2025</time></a>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>This post walks through how I&rsquo;m using Phosphor icons for the Mastodon, Github and Search navigation links on my blog using the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->mnml<!-- raw HTML omitted --> theme.</p>
<p>While <!-- raw HTML omitted -->mnml<!-- raw HTML omitted --> supports the use of icons in page and navigation titles now, I wanted to use only icons when browsed on desktop screens, but use the actual page title links without icons for the mobile responsive menu&hellip;</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>This method <!-- raw HTML omitted -->might<!-- raw HTML omitted --> work for other themes. I haven&rsquo;t tested it nor can I support other themes.</p>
<p>With some tweaks, you could probably use the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Font Awesome Plugin<!-- raw HTML omitted --> for your icons instead. This tutorial doesn&rsquo;t cover that.</p>
<p>Before you publish my code to your live site, I <!-- raw HTML omitted -->very strongly<!-- raw HTML omitted --> encourage you to try it out on your Micro.blog test site first. I can&rsquo;t be held responsible for anything breaking.</p>
<p>Also, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->don&rsquo;t<!-- raw HTML omitted --> change your theme styles directly. It&rsquo;s best to use the Micro.blog Custom CSS option to apply styles.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>The first step is to decide which Phosphor Icons for Micro.blog set you want to use. My example uses the &ldquo;<!-- raw HTML omitted -->Regular<!-- raw HTML omitted -->&rdquo; set.</p>
<p>You should also get the Unicode values of the icons you want to use from the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Phosphor Icons website<!-- raw HTML omitted --> in advance. See comments in the code below about using Unicode values.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>The next step is to create your pages and get their url. In this example, I&rsquo;ve created a Mastodon page with redirect.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>With all the pages I want to use icons for published, knowing their urls, and having icon Unicode values, the final step is to add this CSS to my Micro.blog Custom CSS.</p>
<p>Follow along with the comments in the styles to understand what each declaration does. You should be changing the <code>a[href$=&quot;/url/&quot;]</code> selectors to match your own urls.</p>

<p>If you&rsquo;re a Mac user from the &rsquo;80s and/or &rsquo;90s, you might remember <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kaleidoscope_(software)">Kaleidoscope</a>. If memory serves me, it was installed as a system extension.</p>
<p>I spent hours looking for the perfect theme to apply to my system setup on the Performa I had at the time.</p>
<p>Most of all, I love the design of the <a href="https://macthemes.garden">Mac Themes Garden</a> site itself. I coded a site or two myself back then that looked <em>really</em> similar.</p>

			 <p>It&rsquo;s been a while since my last <a href="/2024/10/25/week-log/">Weeklog post</a>, so it&rsquo;s time to summarize recent events in another one&hellip;</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been quiet online for a bit. After a fairly productive January and February creatively, I sort of hit a wall. Every time I went to post something, it felt forced. I&rsquo;d open whatever app, start writing and then just end up deleting it. I&rsquo;m even finding this post hard to write.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>After more than three years on the &ldquo;long-running project from hell,&rdquo; the final phase deployed last Thursday. It was a total slog to get here, with more than six months of delays on this phase alone. I think the daily grind of it played a big part in why I&rsquo;ve been quiet online. We&rsquo;ll see what next week brings when the Finance teams really start using it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The hot water heater in our RV has gone out again. The last time we had problems, it was a simple relay that needed replacing. This time, it&rsquo;s something different. My poor wife ended up taking a cold shower on our last outing because of it. I worry it&rsquo;s going to take months to get fixed and will impact the trips we already have on calendar. It&rsquo;s forced us to cancel our trip in three weeks. I hope it doesn&rsquo;t force us to cancel any others.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I learned a couple weeks ago my mentor suffered a heart attack back at the beginning of February. Since he only shared it on Facebook, I didn&rsquo;t know it happened until he reached out to cancel our March meeting. I left the Meta platforms completely back in January. From what he&rsquo;s texted me so far, it wasn&rsquo;t super-serious and he&rsquo;s recovering, though it was serious enough to have a defibrillator implanted. Yikes!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I spent last weekend cleaning up the outside of the house and breaking out the gear for summertime. I always feel energized when the back yard furniture is uncovered, knowing good weather and good times are just around the corner.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>On a whim, I upgraded old licenses for <a href="https://www.noodlesoft.com/">Hazel</a> and <a href="https://www.stclairsoft.com/DefaultFolderX/">Default Folder X</a>, and purchased a new license for <a href="https://www.keyboardmaestro.com/main/">Keyboard Maestro</a>. I&rsquo;m trying to figure out how best to integrate them into my workflow.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I decided to jump back on <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/jimmitchell.org">Bluesky</a>. There&rsquo;s a cadre of Salesforce people there I used to interact with when we were all on Twitter. Now that the LRPFH is complete, I&rsquo;ll get back to being active in that ecosystem and thought it good to reconnect.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Speaking of Salesforce, I&rsquo;ve scheduled some training classes over the next month. Thankfully, our contract provides us with free learning. It&rsquo;s time to pursue some of those certifications I&rsquo;ve been putting off.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Finally, I&rsquo;m jazzed that the very last Apple Card payment gets made today. I&rsquo;ve used it to purchase a good amount of tech over the last year. Though it wasn&rsquo;t a huge amount monthly, to have one more creditor wiped off the books feels great.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>That ended up being more than I thought it would be when I first launched <a href="https://red-sweater.com/marsedit">MarsEdit</a> to write. If you made it this far, thanks for reading.</p>
<p>I hope to not be so quiet going forward.</p>

			 <p>What do I like to do on a quiet Saturday afternoon? I like to work on making <strong><a href="https://micro.blog/account/plugins/view/138">mnml</a></strong> even better than it already was, that&rsquo;s what!</p>
<p>I like grid photo layouts well enough, but what I like even more is a nice masonry style photo layout. So, the latest version of <strong>mnml</strong> has the option to choose between a grid or masonry photos layout on your own.</p>
<p><em>Note: I recommend uninstalling any photos plugin you might already be using if you want to use one of the native options because it will override <strong>mnml&rsquo;s</strong> options.</em></p>
<p>But wait, there&rsquo;s more&hellip;</p>
<p>Because some may not want to display every single image from your blog on your photos page, and instead maybe just display images from a particular category, that&rsquo;s an option now as well.</p>
<p>Mess around with the options until you find your happy place. Then blog your heart out.</p>

Yeah, that&rsquo;s a bit of a shameless plug&hellip; Do you blame me?</p>
<p>My mind is blown, and my heart is full.</p>

			 <p>Hot on the tail of <a href="https://jimmitchell.org/2025/01/16/mnml-theme-update-photos-page/">yesterday&rsquo;s <strong>mnml</strong> update</a>, I&rsquo;ve released another update (v2.2.1) that better handles the loading and resizing of images when changing the size of your browser window.</p>
<p>Go to your Micro.blog plugins page to update.</p>
<p>Also, if you&rsquo;d like the photo grid to <em>not quite</em> be full width, here&rsquo;s a trick to make it just a little narrower, like <a href="/photos/">I&rsquo;m doing on my photos page</a>. After setting the full width photos page option, add this CSS snippet to your Micro.blog Custom CSS (Design &gt; Open Theme &gt; Custom CSS) and save it&hellip;</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-css" data-lang="css"><span style="color:#f92672">main</span>.<span style="color:#a6e22e">photos-wide</span> {
    <span style="color:#66d9ef">max-width</span>: <span style="color:#ae81ff">80</span><span style="color:#66d9ef">rem</span>;
}
</code></pre></div><p>That&rsquo;s it. Adjust the max-width value to your liking. You can use either &ldquo;px&rdquo; or &ldquo;rem&rdquo; values. 1rem equals 10px in this theme, so 80rem is equal to 800px in the example above.</p>
<p>Other ideas are in the works. Keep an eye out if you&rsquo;re using <strong>mnml</strong>&hellip; 🤓</p>

			 <p>As I mentioned yesterday, I recently discovered that the photos page for my <strong><a href="https://micro.blog/account/plugins/view/138">mnml</a></strong> theme was not rendering images on the photo page very well without using one of the plugins available in the plugins directory. I&rsquo;ve released an update to version 2.2.0 that fixes this.</p>
<p>While I was at it, I included an option to display your photos grid in either a wide or narrow format. Wide format will show a four-across grid, whereas the default (unchecked) option shows a three-across grid.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>It should be noted that if you&rsquo;re already using a photos plugin, that plugin will override the theme&rsquo;s default photos page and the wide page format will not be enabled.</p>
<p>If you want to see the wide format in action, check out my <a href="/photos/">photos</a> page.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s still a little work to do on this, but it&rsquo;s a heck of a lot better than what it was.</p>
<p>If you have questions, shoot me an <a href="mailto:hello@jimmitchell.org">email</a> or ping me on <a href="https://social.jimmitchell.org/@jim">Mastodon</a>.</p>

			 <p>If you&rsquo;re a Micro.blog user who uses my <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->mnml<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --> theme, I made a few updates I&rsquo;ve been ruminating on for a while that makes it a little more customizable.</p>
<p>Once you&rsquo;ve updated from your Micro.blog plugins page, you&rsquo;ll see a new settings option to manage the customizations.</p>
<h3 id="mnml-settings">mnml Settings</h3>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Each of these settings are outlined below&hellip;</p>
<h3 id="the-custom-icon">The Custom Icon</h3>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Many Micro.blog themes are coded to use your main account profile photo for the header image. If you run multiple blogs on the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Premium plan<!-- raw HTML omitted --> and want to use the same theme for each of them, your sites aren&rsquo;t easily distinguishable.</p>
<p>If you <!-- raw HTML omitted -->do<!-- raw HTML omitted --> want to distinguish one site from the other, this setting is how you do it with <!-- raw HTML omitted -->mnml<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. It also saves you from having to use some weird image for your Micro.blog account in order to brand your site the way you want.</p>
<p>All you have to do is add the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->complete URL<!-- raw HTML omitted --> to any image, and it will display instead of your profile photo. I recommend a simple image no larger than 256 pixels square for this, but feel free to experiment.</p>
<p>If you leave the URL field empty, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->mnml<!-- raw HTML omitted --> uses your Micro.blog account profile photo instead.</p>
<p>Easy-peasy.</p>
<h3 id="categories-on-the-archives-page">Categories on the Archives Page</h3>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Some people have asked how they can show their blog&rsquo;s categories on the Archives page, while others have told me how much they like the fact <!-- raw HTML omitted -->mnml<!-- raw HTML omitted --> doesn&rsquo;t do that.</p>
<p>Being the people pleaser I am, I came up with a way to make everyone happy. If you want to show categories, toggle the setting on and like magic, they&rsquo;ll <!-- raw HTML omitted -->show up<!-- raw HTML omitted --> just like in the screenshot above. If you don&rsquo;t want to display them, leave the setting off.</p>
<h3 id="footer-credits">Footer Credits</h3>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Lastly, I&rsquo;ve added a credit line to the footer of <!-- raw HTML omitted -->mnml<!-- raw HTML omitted --> to drive people to Micro.blog, the theme&rsquo;s Github page, or my own site.</p>
<p>Some of you may not mind having something like this at the bottom of your site pages, and I&rsquo;m grateful to those who leave it on. But some of you may hate it, so you have the option to turn it off completely. I won&rsquo;t be hurt if you do.</p>
<p>Finally, if you&rsquo;re someone who likes and/or uses <!-- raw HTML omitted -->mnml<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, consider supporting my development efforts. Just a <!-- raw HTML omitted -->buck a month<!-- raw HTML omitted --> from a handful of people makes all the difference in the world towards enhancements like these.</p>
<p>Enjoy!</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Let me know questions<!-- raw HTML omitted --> or if you think of an enhancement I might not have.</p>

			 <p>My wife and I discussing regrets this morning&hellip; If you can look back on a mistake, learn something from it, and apply it to your life now, there is no such thing as a regret to me. It was simply a learning moment. That&rsquo;s why I have no regrets in my life. Every dumb choice brought me to right now.</p>

			 <p>I&rsquo;m up early this morning. My plan was to get up at 4:00 am, put the turkey in brine and then go back to bed for a few hours. But as my mind is prone to do, I began pondering all the things in my life I&rsquo;m thankful for.</p>
<p>So I thought I&rsquo;d share some of them.</p>
<hr>
<p>The greatest thing that ever happened in my life is my spouse and life partner.</p>
<p>Our meeting was totally by chance thanks to circumstances that aligned perfectly and a single photograph. Had one of them been just a little bit different, we would have never crossed paths.</p>
<p>We married after a nine-month courtship&ndash;and not for the reason you may be thinking. We were young and foolish and rushed into the permanence of marriage. A lot of people said we wouldn&rsquo;t make it past three years, and there were challenges that took hard work, but after more than 31 years, I can&rsquo;t imagine having spent them with anyone else.</p>
<p>She&rsquo;s the rock that keeps me grounded and my inspiration to keep moving forward.</p>
<hr>
<p>I&rsquo;m grateful for my kids and the impact they&rsquo;ve had in my life.</p>
<p>When my wife and I met, she had two young children from a prior marriage. I took them on as my own since their father chose not to be part of the picture. Then we had a child of our own together.</p>
<p>Raising children humbles a man&ndash;especially when raising step-children.</p>
<p>I won&rsquo;t lie; there were hard times and challenges with them over the last three decades, but all three turned out to be level-headed moral adults.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m proud of the individual each of them have become and am humbled to see a tiny reflection of me in them.</p>
<hr>
<p>I&rsquo;m thankful I was given a chance to recover my health.</p>
<p>This year was a wake up call. It&rsquo;s been nearly ten months since &ldquo;<a href="https://jimmitchell.org/2024/03/06/on-the-fragility-of-life/">the episode</a>&rdquo; and it still rattles me that it could have been the end of it all.</p>
<p>I see life differently now and am grateful for every morning I open my eyes, even when I don&rsquo;t seem like it.</p>
<hr>
<p>I appreciate that someone who is now a very close friend took the time to mentor me in my darkest hour and when my outlook of the future was grim.</p>
<p>He listened to me bitch about a lot of stupid stuff for almost ten years, but always challenged me to look at it from a different angle. I&rsquo;m a completely different person thanks to his wisdom.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll forever be in his debt for the change he made in me.</p>
<hr>
<p>I&rsquo;m glad for my job and the career path I landed in totally by mistake.</p>
<p>I may gripe about the grind of it sometimes, but I love that I&rsquo;m challenged by the work. It allows me to be creative and bring something to life that makes the lives of others a little better.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m blessed to enjoy doing what I do for a living.</p>
<hr>
<p>Then, I&rsquo;m thankful for the little things.</p>
<p>Life is magical when you take the time to step back and look at it. Every moment in your life, good or bad, has lead to this moment, whether it&rsquo;s good or bad. This good or bad moment will lead to other good and bad moments.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a godsend to be able to look back and see how it&rsquo;s unfolded over a lifetime.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m truly a very lucky man.</p>
<hr>
<p>Of course, I&rsquo;m thankful for you and the fact you took the time to read what I&rsquo;ve just written.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m fortunate to have connected with some awesome people online. Though you and I may never meet IRL, I&rsquo;m glad you share the insight into your life by what you write, and that you care enough about my own life to engage back with me.</p>
<p>Happy Thanksgiving to those who celebrate&hellip;</p>

			 <p>I took some time off work during the Thanksgiving holiday after grinding on a work project for a really long time. I&rsquo;ve found myself at a point over the last six months where I just don&rsquo;t feel effective and needed to figure out why.</p>
<p>During my quiet time this morning, I picked up <em>&quot;<a href="https://sive.rs/n">Hell Yeah or No</a>&quot;</em> by Derek Sivers again. I bought the physical book a couple months ago with a plan to finish it quickly. But, as I tend to do, I read about 10 pages and then set it aside, telling myself I&rsquo;ll get back to it eventually.</p>
<p>As I was powering through the book&rsquo;s anecdotes, one jumped <a href="https://sive.rs/no2">off the page</a> and grabbed my attention.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Hell yeah or no&rdquo; is a filter you can use to decide what&rsquo;s worth doing. But this is simpler and more serious. <strong>This is a decision to stop deciding.</strong> It&rsquo;s one decision, in advance, that the answer to all future distractions is &ldquo;no&rdquo; until you finish what you started. <strong>It&rsquo;s saying yes to one thing, and no to absolutely everything else.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>I struck me that I&rsquo;ve been saying yes far too often again. I&rsquo;ll get a great idea for a project and dive head first into it, while having a half-dozen similar projects already in the works.</p>
<p>There are also commitments to others I&rsquo;ve said yes to that I don&rsquo;t want to show up for anymore. I have a bad habit of volunteering for something without thinking it through and it eventually becomes a drain on my energy.</p>
<p>What I need to do is focus on the &ldquo;one big thing for now,&rdquo; and only that thing until it&rsquo;s finished. Everything else new is a hard no. There are still those commitments I have to show up for, but I don&rsquo;t have to put 100% effort into them until the one big thing is done.</p>
<p>The challenge now is to figure out what that one big thing is.</p>

<p>The American Flag is a representation of our country, our people, and our devotion to our nation. Respecting the American Flag and the principles that it symbolizes requires us to treat it with a high level of care at all times. The United States Flag Code sets forth key guidelines for properly handling the American Flag.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There are a lot of self-proclaimed &ldquo;patriots&rdquo; out there who need to familiarize themselves with these rules. I&rsquo;ve knocked on the doors of strangers I&rsquo;ve seen flying the American flag wrong more than once.</p>

			 <p>I went to bed concerned with what I was seeing, but with the hope that democracy would do its thing and a tyrant would be defeated. I was confident common sense and a <strong>true</strong> sense of patriotism would prevail. I slept soundly.</p>
<p>I awoke to what I can only see as a disastrous future. I&rsquo;m stunned, sickened, angry and scared all at the same time.</p>
<p>I have no words. I have many thoughts, but no words.</p>
<p>When this man was elected in 2016, I was not a fan of the outcome. My wife and I didn&rsquo;t vote for him ourselves and we were sure then democracy would prevail.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, he ended up president elect and, though we thought better of it, my wife and I agreed we&rsquo;d support the Office of the President since that&rsquo;s what a good American does: Win or lose, you accept the outcome and support your country&rsquo;s leader.</p>
<p>We changed our minds pretty damn fast.</p>
<p>Eight years later, we&rsquo;re looking at another four years of what I can only call pure hell.</p>
<p>Has history taught us nothing?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m stunned. I&rsquo;m sickened. I&rsquo;m angry. And I&rsquo;m scared.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m stunned, sickened, angry and scared because more than half of our nation believes an unhinged man with fascist tendencies is the best option to lead our country.</p>
<p>What have we come to?</p>
<p>Rome was once a great nation, but its time eventually came to an end. How close is America to its fall?</p>
<p>Far too close now, I fear&hellip;</p>

			 <p>Since this question will likely come sooner or later&hellip;</p>
<p>When I was developing <a href="https://micro.blog/account/plugins/view/138">mnml</a>, I wanted to give users the ability to set their own link colors for both light and dark modes. However, in my testing, there were challenges that would have caused colors a user set to get overwritten if I needed to release an update. So, another approach was needed.</p>
<p>If you end up using mnml yourself and want to change link colors, here&rsquo;s how you do it&hellip;</p>
<p>In your Micro.blog custom CSS settings, add the following CSS snippet, adjusting the hex colors as you like. This example gets you a nice <!-- raw HTML omitted -->magenta<!-- raw HTML omitted --> color for both light and dark modes.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-css" data-lang="css">@<span style="color:#66d9ef">media</span> <span style="color:#f92672">(</span><span style="color:#f92672">prefers-color-scheme</span><span style="color:#f92672">:</span> <span style="color:#f92672">light</span><span style="color:#f92672">)</span> {

			 <p>Taking ideas from a few others, I&rsquo;m going to try something new and start a long form post of things that happened during the week. The goal is a stream of consciousness that gets published with minimal editing. Just write and publish &ndash; though <em>some</em> copy editing is allowed&hellip;</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>It&rsquo;s been a few weeks since I <a href="https://jimmitchell.org/2024/10/11/and-just-like.html">returned to Micro.blog</a>. I&rsquo;d let my account lapse and was simply going to focus all my efforts on the WordPress VPS I was running. But the drama in that community kind of soured me. I could have ignored it and just plodded on, but it was really the breakpoint of several other things that made me decide to abandon it. In my return, I was reminded just how engaging the Micro.blog community is. I&rsquo;m glad to be back.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I managed to snarf my Mastodon presence by moving around a little too much. When I started, I had a whopping 94 followers. By the time I was done, I was down to just seven. Thanks to <a href="https://social.lol/@ameripie">Lou Plummer</a> for the <a href="https://social.lol/@amerpie/113359642081637291">shoutout</a> to help me recover a little (thanks Lou). I gained some interesting new followers in it. I&rsquo;m not back to 94, but then I&rsquo;m not at seven either&hellip;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I forked a couple of <a href="https://micro.blog/manton">Manton&rsquo;s</a> Micro.blog plugins and tweaked them for my own needs. One of them turned out good enough that I might release it as a new plugin for others. Or, I might do a pull request on his version so he can include my features if he likes. I&rsquo;m not sure which approach I&rsquo;m going to take yet.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I took a refresher course on first-aid and CPR this week. I was certified as a Boy Scout in my early teen years to get my first-aid merit badge. Some things have changed since, but for the most part, I remembered it all and was the class star pupil.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Stepping on the scale this morning, my app says I&rsquo;ve lost a total of 53.4 lbs since the height of the pandemic, which is encouraging. I&rsquo;m at a weight lower than I was in high school and I&rsquo;m wearing a pant size smaller than I can ever recall. Sugar is my nemesis and I have to battle it daily &ndash; but I&rsquo;m winning. I almost started making hot chocolate a daily habit this week, but came to my senses after a couple of days.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I plan to get my head back into SwiftUI this week. I was progressing well, but let fatigue from the day job get the better of me over the last month &ndash; which I used as an excuse to sit on my butt and watch YouTube videos. The goal to resurrect my old apps will get nowhere if I continue like that.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Speaking of the day job, the LRPFH (long-running project from hell) continues to grind on. It was slated to go live back in April of this year, but delays because of one thing or another has pushed it out to next month &ndash; and that&rsquo;s if all goes well for the next two weeks. I&rsquo;m going to take a two-week vacation away from technology once we get this project fully live, which is supposed to be February 2025.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>That&rsquo;s it for this week. We&rsquo;ll see if the Week Log series continues next week.</p>
<p>Time for the first meeting of the day&hellip;</p>

<p>“We were unaware that Matt redirected sign-up emails until current Automattic employees contacted our support team,” a spokesperson for Blind told me, adding that they’d “never seen a CEO or executive try to limit their employees from signing up for Blind by redirecting emails.”</p>

<p>Having Slack access, as do all WordPress.org plugin and theme authors, I can confirm community moral is in decline. Many developers have been banned from Slack for their dissension.</p>
<p>Related: Here&rsquo;s an interesting read I came across this morning in three parts. Having interviewed with Automattic once myself nearly 15 years ago, I can confirm the interview process was somewhat lacking even back then.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>It’s not clear what security problem Mullenweg is referring to in the post. He writes that he’s &ldquo;invoking point 18 of the plugin directory guidelines,&rdquo; in which the WordPress team reserves several rights, including removing a plugin, or changing it &ldquo;without developer consent.&rdquo; Mullenweg explains that the move has to do with WP Engine’s recently-filed lawsuit against him and Automattic.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>To me, Mullenweg is totally abusing his power as the &ldquo;sole owner&rdquo; of WordPress.org here, and (as others point out) has forced a hostile takeover of the work of other developers. If he can do it for one, he can do it for all. I want no part of this kind of &ldquo;open source&rdquo; drama. It was the final straw in me abandoning the WordPress platform completely.</p>
<p>Though I have a couple of plugins of my own in the repository, I&rsquo;ll only be maintaining them for security reasons. I considered pulling them altogether, but I don&rsquo;t want to leave any users who may be using them stranded.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>Remember the late 90s and early 2000s when personal blogs were <em>the</em> thing? Everybody had one and they were like online journals; authentic, raw, and an outlet for personal thoughts, ideas, and sometimes questionable opinions.</p>
<p>It kind of feels like those days are behind us, buried under the avalanche of social media. But are they really?</p>
<h3 id="social-media-and-the-decline-of-the-blog">Social Media and the Decline of the Blog</h3>
<p>It didn’t happen overnight. Personal blogs didn’t just disappear in one big poof. It was more like a slow fade. As Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter took off, people – me included – found it easier to share bite-sized pieces of life. Why write a long, reflective post to publish on your personal site when you could sum it up in a quick status update that some “friend” you don’t really even know could give you a mindless like?</p>
<p>Therein lies the rub. Social media is all about convenience – fast, visual, and designed for quick consumption – like fast food for the mind. Scroll, like, move on. Blogs, on the other hand, ask for your time and thought. They’re like the home-cooked meals we don’t have time for anymore.</p>
<h3 id="loss-of-depth">Loss of Depth</h3>
<p>Blogs were once a place for people to dive deep into ideas, emotions, and experiences. It wasn’t about only broadcasting the best parts of your life, but reflecting on the messiness, struggles, and painful lessons. You could get to know someone through their writing – see how they think, feel, and evolve over time.</p>
<p>Social media, on the other hand, with its character limits and algorithms pushing sensational, click-worthy content, doesn’t offer the same depth. Everything is a sizzle reel. You can still share long posts or threads, but how often do people really read them? We’ve learned to skim content, always hungry for the next hit of dopamine from a new notification or like.</p>
<h3 id="why-blogs-mattered-and-still-do">Why Blogs Mattered… And Still Do</h3>
<p>There’s something about the personal blog that social media can’t replace. It’s not just about the writing. It’s about ownership. On a blog, you control the narrative. There’s no algorithm deciding whether a post will be seen or buried. Your thoughts are out there for whoever chooses to engage with them, free from the noise of sponsored or promoted posts and trending hashtags.</p>
<p>While social media offers instant gratification – likes, short comments, shares – a blog provides something deeper: connection. Real connection, with people who take the time to engage with your words because they want to, not because a platform nudged them into it.</p>
<h3 id="the-shift-to-niche-and-professional-blogging">The Shift to Niche and Professional Blogging</h3>
<p>Blogs were never really dead, but they’ve changed a lot since the early days. A good personal blog is hard to find now. Instead, we see more niche or professional blogs, where people share expert advice, reviews, or tutorials. These are useful, but often lack a personal touch that made blogging feel intimate back in the day.</p>
<p>Many of those people have turned their personal blogs into a business, focusing on SEO and monetization rather than genuine self-expression. While there’s nothing wrong with making money, it’s a far cry from the humble beginnings of blogging as a space for pure, unfiltered thoughts.</p>
<p>To be clear; you will never see an ad on my blog. This space is purely for my rumination – be it good or bad – and interactions with those who read.</p>
<h3 id="can-personal-blogging-make-a-comeback">Can Personal Blogging Make a Comeback?</h3>
<p>Maybe. There’s a growing disdain against the superficiality of social media. People are beginning to tire of the endless scrolling, filtered versions of someone else’s perfect life, and the pressure to perform. People are coming back around to authenticity and real conversations. There’s no better place for that than a personal blog.</p>
<p>For those of us who still love the art of long-form writing, and who crave meaningful connections over mindless scrolling, personal blogs offer a haven. My site may not get the instant attention or the engagement of a social post, but that’s the point – it’s meant for something deeper.</p>
<p>Is social media the death of the personal blog? Not quite. It may have nearly killed it, yes. But for those of us willing to carve out our own space in the digital landscape, personal blogs still have a heartbeat. It just takes more effort to keep it alive.</p>
<p>What do you think? Is blogging a lost art, or is there hope for a revival? Start (or join) the conversation in the comments below. Or write about it on your own blog if you still have one and link back to this post. My site will automatically link back to yours – just like in the old days.</p>
<p>It’s time to get meaningful conversations happening again. Personal blogs are the perfect place for it.</p>

			 <p>I picked up an Apple Magic Keyboard with Touch ID today (not the extended model). I&rsquo;ve been using an Apple extended Bluetooth keyboard forever, so the hand placement feels a little different. I do like the new smaller size under my hands, and thoroughly like the touch sensor being &ldquo;right here.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Is it time to say goodbye to USB-A? Maybe. Probably. But no matter how you feel about that, it’s absolutely time something new happened with the Mac Mini, the longest-in-the-tooth Apple computer design.</p>

<p>We portable users have been living with dongles forever. I would agree it&rsquo;s time for USB-A to be sunset on the Mac mini, especially if the form factor is about the size of an Apple TV device.</p>

			 <p>I remember the first time I touched a computer. I was in my early twenties and worked as a customer service rep for the local water company, which was a fancy way of saying I played in the mud nearly every day.</p>
<p>The company had just switched over from a paper and pencil method of recording meter readings to a hand-held reader, which would be connected to a computer after reading a route for the day to upload results. It was a lot faster and saved the meter readers from having to take a bunch of books with them on their routes each day.</p>
<p>As a CSR, I had to be able to lookup a customer information, such as when they last paid their bill, the meter readings for the last number of months and so on.</p>
<p>Lou Plummer’s post about a <a href="https://louplummer.lol/a-computer-is-a-hammer/">computer being a hammer</a> reminded me of how scared I was to touch the thing, worried I would somehow mess something up and cause everything to crash. But I learned it, and soon found it to be a useful tool.</p>
<p>Fast forward a few years. I decided that playing in the mud was not something I wanted to do for the rest of my life, so I pursued learning accounting at one of those fly-by-night technical colleges that were prolific in the early nineties. This is where I learned to type by touch – a skill a lot of people could still use to learn.</p>
<p>After graduating the tech college, I landed an accounting job at Guitar Center corporate, which you’d think would be a musician’s dream. I found it to be boring with little opportunity for creative expression. After moving from accounting to the inventory management team, I first got my hands on a Mac SE.</p>
<p>I would travel to the stores across the country and inventory their hardware and accessories. The Mac SE was used to reconcile the serialized product they kept on 3“ x 5” index cards to our inventory sheets. This is where I learned 10-key by touch. I also learned how to use MacPaint and Excel to create flyers for the band I was in.</p>
<p>I went on to another company doing clerical that also gave me access to a Mac. This is where I started helping others with their Mac problems. What they didn’t know is I was figuring it out on the fly, learning as I fixed their computer. I have a mind for problem solving, so I looked like a hero to my coworkers. I was still doing band flyers with MacPaint and Excel too.</p>
<p>The staff design artist decided he wanted to move on. He and I had established a rapport with each other as Mac bros, and when he left, I just sort of fell into his position. This is how I moved from accounting to design. The company was generous enough to send me to school where I got my degree in design. My new career path gave me full-time access to a Mac. I was in heaven. This is when learned the fine art of FTP.</p>
<p>I started hearing about this thing called the internet, which led me to sign up for AOL for a while. I moved on to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EWorld">eWorld</a> shortly after. I still think eWorld was way better than AOL.</p>
<p>I somehow stumbled on this thing called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FidoNet">FidoNet</a> that is a network of individual computers. I began running my own <a href="https://hermesbbs.com/about/">Heremes BBS</a> on a discarded Mac SE and put it up as a node the FidoNet network. I was finally online and had access to my own personal email. I’d tweak settings endlessly, learning about communication protocols. The year I ran that BBS was one of the most enlightening in my tech journey.</p>
<p>After that, I moved to an online internet provider named Z4 Internet that gave me a place to host my own web pages. This is how I taught myself to code html by hand using BBEdit. No WYSIWYG editors for this guy.</p>
<p>The years between then and now are a blur, but from then on, I was forever a traveler of the “internet super-highway” as I once put it to my wife. She thought I was a dork when I said it, but she gets it now.</p>
<p>At my next employer, I moved from design into database and web development where I learned to code Java, Javascript, and PHP while honing my html and css skills. By a stroke of luck, I landed in the <a href="https://www.salesforce.com">Salesforce</a> ecosystem nearly 15 years ago and have remained there ever since.</p>
<p>Somewhere in those years, I developed a Mac utility app named <a href="/yasu/">Yasu</a>, which was short for “Yet another system utility.” I’ll have to write a story about that time one day. Being an indie Mac developer were some of the best years of my life.</p>
<p>My journey has been a series of right place, right time moments. I wouldn’t change any of them to be where I am today. I sometimes think back to that time I was so afraid to touch a keyboard at the water company. I can’t imagine a life without technology now. It’s allowed me some of my most creatively explosive growth and connections with people that mean a lot to me.</p>
<p>I’ve been blessed by my time on the internet to say the least.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>Here’s another one of those childhood memories that left a scar; literally. This one is about the time I tried to stop my out of control bicycle using a barbed wire fence.</p>
<p>It was probably as painful as it sounds. Honestly, I can’t remember if it was.</p>
<p>Around the time I was <a href="/cigarettes/">stealing cigarettes from my mother</a>, I was also learning how to ride a bicycle. Wicked step-father and mom didn’t want to teach me. I was simply handed a bike and left to figure it out on my own.</p>
<p>Self-reliance ended up being a theme throughout my childhood, and is a big reason for my reluctance to rely on others to this day. Mom thought she was doing me a favor, but I’m not too sure about that decision…</p>
<p>Anyway, the bike mom and wicked step-father brought home for me was a <a href="https://i.pinimg.com/originals/b5/c6/f5/b5c6f5889ee84685949bfa1b001df6e4.jpg">blue and white Schwinn girl’s model</a>. I recall that it <em>looked</em> fairly new, so they must’ve spent some amount of money on it – but dammit, it was a <em>girl’s</em> bike. Thank god we lived on a farm with no other kids around. I would have been the laughing stock of my peers otherwise.</p>
<p>To teach myself how to ride, I would run along beside the bike, and once I was running fast enough, I would let the bike go so it would “ride” along by itself. I have no idea why my seven year-old boy brain thought this was the way to learn, but it just seemed right at the time.</p>
<p>This went on for a while with me losing and gaining interest in the bike. Eventually, I somehow learned how to balance and pedal. I can’t remember how, but it happened because I’m able to ride a bike today. I have a vague recollection that maybe one of wicked step-father’s adult sons had pity on me and took it on himself to teach me.</p>
<p>Not long after figuring out how to pedal without falling, I got daring and chose to ride down the quarter-mile long dirt driveway. On the left side was a barbed wire fence, on the right side was a big open wheat field.</p>
<p>Since I hadn’t mastered the art of using friction brakes, which way do you think I ended up steering when I lost control? You guessed it. I steered towards the barbed wire fence.</p>
<p>As I got close to it, I instinctively reached out for the fence to slow myself down. I quickly learned that one does not simply stop when grabbing barbed wire. Nope. One continues on for a bit as the rusty barbs tear into the palm of your hand before you wind up stopping.</p>
<p>I can’t recall the pain, but I do remember the blood. Lots of blood. Did I end up getting stitches? No. Should I have? Probably.</p>
<p>After ditching the bike on the side of the driveway, I ran back to the house screaming hysterically, clutching my left wrist while the blood ran down my forearm. My hand looked like hamburger and I was freaked out.</p>
<p>When I got to my mother, she inspected it, washed the cut, put Neosporin on it and wrapped it with a couple Kleenex and the funky pink paper tape she wore at night to keep the curls at her temples in place while she slept. I wouldn’t call it a good field dressing by any means. There was no tetanus shot, and there definitely wasn’t a doctor visit.</p>
<p>I don’t remember anything about the incident after that or how my hand went on to heal, but it did. I think I’ve blocked all of it out. I did go on to ride the blue Schwinn girl’s bike without hitting any more fences.</p>
<p>It’s been more than 50 years since this happened and I can still make out the very faint long scar in the palm of my left hand. I always go back to this memory when I see any barbed wire fence. It’s left both a physical and mental scar that has lasted a lifetime.</p>

			 <p>I’m saddened to learn of the passing of Henry Carvajal yesterday after battling cancer for a year and a half.</p>
<p>I can’t say he and I were close friends, but when I was active in the Long Beach Blues scene, I was privileged to have shared the stage with him more than a dozen times.</p>
<p>Henry had chops and a great voice. He had style too. And to top it off, he was one of the more gracious musicians I’ve known.</p>

<p>The photo above is the last time I got to play with him on New Year’s Eve, 2017. Henry’s on guitar, I’m on bass.</p>
<p>My wife and I went to support the band I used to play with and the evening turned into a jam session, as they always seemed to. Though I may not be part of that scene anymore, we have good memories of that night.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>Hearing of the <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c51y3reng3zo">passing of Martin Mull</a> reminded me of the time that I sort of met him quite by accident.</p>
<p>My daughter was a pretty good softball player in her early teens and would make the All-Star team in the town we lived in each season. I can’t remember what year or tournament it was, but we were at one of those all-weekend travel ball tournaments in Ventura, CA. It was still early in the morning and I went to the snack bar for a cup of coffee to shake the spiderwebs from my brain.</p>
<p>As I remember it, a humorous thing happened between me and the snack bar person. Out of nowhere, there was Martin Mull with a witty remark about the situation right next to me in line. I immediately recognized who he was, but was too starstruck to engage with him. I mumbled some incoherent thing back to him and walked off with my coffee. He must’ve thought I was a clod. I wish I’d handled that differently.</p>
<p>In hindsight, it struck me that he was exactly the same person I’d seen on TV so many times. His comedic timing was perfect for the moment. I think what threw me was that he was the one who engaged with me first. His level of fame allowed for him to just keep to himself, but he chose not to. That day, he was just another dad at the tournament with his daughter’s softball team.</p>
<p>I always remember the day I sort of met him when I see an episode of some sitcom he was in. I especially enjoyed his work in Roseanne.</p>
<p>In honor of his passing, I think I might watch a little <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLA406B241A9114BFA">Fernwood 2Night</a>, tonight&hellip;</p>

			 <p>Events happen in our lives that make us do a full stop and give a long, hard look at how things are. This was one of those events that slapped me in the face so hard I&rsquo;m still having a hard time grasping it.</p>
<p>About a week ago, I had a heart related event that sent me to the emergency room. It was serious enough that the doctor point blank told me it could have been deadly had I not paid attention to it.</p>
<p>When I woke up at 3:30 am last Thursday, my heart was palpitating and racing at over 150 bpm. I thought for sure I was having a heart attack. I woke my wife and we sped to the closest ER (she drove).</p>
<p>When the doctor examined me, my heart was in an state of Afib (<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/atrial-fibrillation/symptoms-causes/syc-20350624">atrial fibrillation</a>). They pumped me full of drugs to bring my heart below 100 bpm and hopefully put me back into a sinus rhythm. They were able to get the heart rate down a little, but it fluctuated between 90 and 120 bpm for hours. They weren&rsquo;t able to get me back into a sinus rhythm either.</p>
<p>Ultimately, I was admitted to the hospital. My heart finally went back into a sinus rhythm after 19 very exhausting hours. After several tests, the cardiologist was able to determine this is a defect I&rsquo;ve had all my life. I&rsquo;d had small episodes as long as I can remember, but never thought anything of it. It&rsquo;s forcing some big changes to my lifestyle. Thankfully, I&rsquo;m still here to write about it.</p>
<p>The most terrible and heartbreaking part of this story is that another man, just a year younger than me (having overheard his age), was put into the ER bed right next to me complaining of excruciating back pain. Like me, he walked in under his own power. Within 30 minutes of arrival, he went unresponsive and ultimately passed away from heart failure. The ER staff worked furiously to bring him back for a long time. At one point he did resuscitate, but before they could get him to the ICU, he crashed again. There was nothing they could do for this man. So tragic.</p>
<p>This all happened right next to my wife and I before we knew what was going on with my own heart. It scared the living shit out of both of us, and I&rsquo;ll never, ever forget it.</p>
<p>Life is <em>really</em> fucking short and can be taken from you in a heartbeat &ndash; literally.</p>
<p>I should not be living to work. I should be working to live a full life with &ndash; and for &ndash; those most important to me. It&rsquo;s easy to get wrapped up in a career. To hell with that now! Family and friends are what matter. And so does living a life that makes a difference to them. It took nearly six decades to see it clearly. I&rsquo;m grateful I was shown the lesson with enough time to do something about it.</p>
<p>No matter what, hold your loved ones close. Let them know you love them every day. Patch the broken relationships even though it&rsquo;s hard. Live each day with gratitude and wonder, because you could be gone in a matter of moments.</p>

			 <p>Add me to the list of Apple Watch wearers who were saved from a life threatening event. My watch alerted me to an AFib event that sent me to the ER yesterday. The cardiologist told me if I’d ignored the warning, it might have lead to a stroke, or even death. A sobering 24 hours to say the least&hellip;</p>

			 <p>I planned on publishing a post like this myself, but <a href="https://micro.blog/canion">@canion</a> beat me to the punch, <a href="https://canion.blog/2023/12/03/my-mac-apps.html">getting his out first</a>… I’m going to use the same criteria he uses for making the cut:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>For my purposes, to be considered an App of the Year, the software needs to be something I used extensively, value and enjoy. I also must feel I would miss them if they suddenly went away. Of course, it also needs to be a Mac App.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Without further ado, my list of the top five…</p>
<h3 id="launchbar">LaunchBar</h3>
<p>I’ve been using <a href="https://obdev.at/products/launchbar/index.html">LaunchBar</a> since 2005, probably longer than any other Mac app I currently use, save BBEdit. I set up my wife’s old 2012 27&quot; iMac last week to install macOS Sonoma via <a href="https://dortania.github.io/OpenCore-Legacy-Patcher/">OpenCore Legacy Patcher</a>, and through each step, I found my muscle memory wanting to launch some app with LaunchBar. I easily use this app a hundred times a day, every day.</p>
<h3 id="fantastical">Fantastical</h3>
<p>I live and die by my calendar these days. For me, the only calendar application worthy of being used on a Mac is <a href="https://flexibits.com/fantastical">Fantastical</a>, hands-down. The natural language input is super useful and slick. The premium feature I love the most is Openings. For my work, I’ve got too many people wanting to meet with me for this or that. All I have to do is give them a URL and tell them to find an opening. This has saved me hours. I hate subscriptions, but to me, this app is worth it.</p>
<h3 id="safari">Safari</h3>
<p>I’ve been a Chrome user for many years now. But, two things made me change to Safari this year. First, Chrome has become a memory hog. As I write this, for the same five tabs open, Chrome is using 235MB of memory among 45 threads, whereas Safari is only using 151MB across 10 threads. Less memory and thread usage means better battery life. Second is the privacy philosophies between Apple and Google. Enough said on that one.</p>
<h3 id="ivory">Ivory</h3>
<p>I’ve been on Mastodon since 2018, but as the platform becomes more popular and my use picks up, I find myself leaning more and more on <a href="https://tapbots.com/ivory/">Ivory</a>. I started out with Mona as my Mastodon client – which is a great app too – but I just find myself gravitating more and more to Ivory. I can’t put my finger on why. It’s just the one I prefer between the two.</p>
<h3 id="bbedit">BBEdit</h3>
<p>Parts of my job require me to transform and manipulate large amounts of data in all kinds of ways. When it comes to a text editor (for .csv files), <a href="http://www.barebones.com/products/bbedit/index.html">BBEdit</a> is <em>the</em> application of choice for me. I’ve been using BBEdit since version 1.0, even longer than I’ve been using LaunchBar. I’d die without this app. For me, it’s worth the $30 upgrade every few years. If you’re a long-time Mac user, you know what BBEdit is and what it’s capable of.</p>
<h3 id="apps-that-fell-off-the-list">Apps That Fell Off the List</h3>
<p>Since this is the first year of my list, I can’t really say what fell off the prior, but these are the apps I’ve found myself using less and less over the last year or two.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Reeder</strong> - in favor of <a href="https://netnewswire.com">NetNewsWire</a>. Both are really great apps, and I’m flopping back and forth between the two right now, but NetNewsWire is slightly edging out Reeder.</li>
<li><strong>Google Chrome</strong> - in favor of Safari, obviously.</li>
<li><strong>Agenda</strong> - I like the calendar integration of Agenda, but like <a href="https://micro.blog/canion">@canion</a>, I’m leaning more towards <a href="https://obisidan.md">Obsidian</a> for note taking as of late.</li>
</ol>

<p>Since 2015, several data centers have been submerged underwater in both the Pacific Ocean and Atlantic Ocean. The first underwater data center was deployed by Microsoft into the Pacific Ocean, off the coast of California, through an experiment called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_Natick">Project Natick</a>, with Phase 1 being a vessel carrying 1 rack, containing 24 servers.</p>

<p>How is it I&rsquo;ve never heard about this until now?</p>

			 <p>There’s a lot of hubbub in the news and online about the “new Beatles song” that dropped yesterday. As a life-long semi-pro musician, this headline hits a sour note with me.</p>
<p>Hah! See what I did there? Anyway, my thoughts…</p>
<p>This song was one of many demos Lennon did after the band broke up. This is key. While we don’t know for sure, it’s unlikely he said to himself “<em>This would be a great Beatles song. I should ring up the lads.</em>” when composing the tune.</p>
<p>Lennon’s widow “gave” the demo tapes to the remaining Beatles <em>years</em> after his tragic murder and even longer after the band had officially broke up. The tape Yoko turned over is purported to contain at least three of Lennon’s demos, not just this one song.</p>
<p>Paul, George, and Ringo messed around with the recording, laying down all new tracks for the song. I’m sure they did this with the other demo songs too. But that’s all it is; they messed around with a demo of their deceased former bandmate. Lennon was not there to collaborate as a band member. Releasing a song as a “band” means all members have provided input on the final product. This fact alone makes the song <em>not</em> a Beatles song.</p>
<p>Fast forward 25 years. Now we have machine learning that can digitally enhance anyone’s voice, and even reproduce a near perfect representation of vocals from unrelated sample files. This is how Lennon’s lyrics were included in the song – by digitally reproducing and enhancing something that was barely audible to begin with. Ultimately, these are not Lennon’s true vocals. They are a damn good representation of the man’s voice enhanced by computers.</p>
<p>The use of AI bodes poorly for musicians who create their art. Will we start seeing demos of other bands which were never intended to see the light of day getting released by record labels as “the lost album of (band name here)”? I bet we will. We already are. As a result, the soul of recorded music is lost and it’s just become about the money for record labels.</p>
<p>The list of credits for this song is long. But in the end, it’s still just a well (over?) produced John Lennon demo and not a Beatles recording. He is the only “songwriter” who I believe should be credited.</p>

		<a href="https://jimmitchell.org/2023/04/14/a-better-applescript-to-compress/" class="u-url"><time class="dt-published" datetime="2023-04-14 12:34:10 -0800">Apr 14, 2023</time></a>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>A while ago, I created an AppleScript that allows you to <a href="/2014/08/02/applescript-to-compress-files-and-folders/">compress files and folders</a> by simply dropping them onto the applet.</p>
<p>One of the readers left a comment asking for a way to achieve the following tasks:</p>
<blockquote>
<ol>
<li>Select a folder from Finder.</li>
<li>Store the folder name as “x”.</li>
<li>Compress all files and sub-folders within the folder “x”, including their paths.</li>
<li>Rename the resulting zip file as “x.zip”.</li>
<li>Delete all the files that were used to create the zip file.</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<p>With the help of ChatGPT – and because I wanted to be lazy about it – I was able to come up with a solution to this challenge, which can be a great way to manage archives if that’s important to you.</p>
<p>I must admit that ChatGPT did a decent job in generating the AppleScript, but there were some bugs that I had to fix manually. Nevertheless, it’s both scary and exciting to have a tool that can generate usable code.</p>
<p>As always, you can run this script using <a href="http://www.red-sweater.com/fastscripts/">FastScripts</a> from your menu bar for quick and easy access.</p>

			 <p>No matter how well-intentioned we are, sometimes we allow things to sneak into our lives under the guise of it being something important.</p>
<p>We ask “<em>Who else can do this?</em>” Or maybe we tell ourselves “<em>No one else is qualified enough, so I’m the one who has to do it.</em>”</p>
<p>When we start thinking like this, it’s our ego calling the shots. Maybe we want to be the hero, or we worry those who needed us in the past no longer will and that we won’t be their go-to person anymore.</p>
<p>Our ego persuades us take on more and more, forcing us to say yes when our heart is telling us we should be saying no. Before we know it, the commitments have piled up on us again.</p>
<p>We wake up one day and realize we’ve allowed so many things back into our lives that we dread getting out of bed and facing them. We’re over-committed again and can no longer see the forest for the trees in our lives.</p>
<p>When this happens to me, I make a day of solitude away from distractions and reflect on how I got to this point again. Then I figure out what I need to do to get life back on track.</p>
<p>I accept I won’t always be able to say no when I should. The only thing I can do is learn from caving in to my ego and grow from it.</p>
<p>When I’m stretched thin, these are some of the things I do to start cutting out the commitments that I should have said no to from the beginning.</p>
<h2 id="whos-affected">Who&rsquo;s Affected?</h2>
<p>I ask myself who’s affected most?</p>
<p>Naturally, the person I’ll be letting down will be disappointed, but I ask myself who else has been neglected because I have so much on my plate?</p>
<p>Usually it’s my family that suffers most when I allow distractions. It’s easy to forget these are the important relationships to nurture. They’re the ones that are always the closest, so it’s easy to put them on the back burner. I learn more and more when I overcommit that I should be guarding these relationships fiercely.</p>
<p>Not only does my family suffer, but so does my health. I end up having so much going on that I don’t get proper sleep, exercise and I don’t eat well enough.</p>
<p>In the end, I wind up feeling burnt-out on life as a whole and get cranky with everyone around me. The most important relationships have wound up paying the price because I said yes when I should have said no.</p>
<h2 id="can-someone-else-do-it">Can Someone Else Do It?</h2>
<p>I have to let go of my ego and turn the work over to someone else who can do the job just as well as I would have, if not better.</p>
<p>I remind myself I’m not the only person in the world who has the talents to tackle a particular project. In fact, there may even be someone else who’s much more qualified than I ever was. This helps to remind me it’s okay to step aside.</p>
<p>It might even be good to let someone who isn’t as capable handle it. Allowing people to be challenged is usually when they grow the most.</p>
<h2 id="is-it-important">Is it Important?</h2>
<p>Sometimes the thing someone asked from me really isn’t as important to them as I think it is. I have to ask them how important it is that I be the one to do it for them.</p>
<p>Maybe they don’t even care about it anymore, or know of someone else who can do it in my place. I’ll never know unless I ask.</p>
<h2 id="hold-your-ground">Hold Your Ground</h2>
<p>Of course, backing out of a commitment is akin to lighting a match that’ll burn a bridge. I have to be open to being the target for disappointment and hurt feelings.</p>
<p>But I also have be ready to share how the commitment is affecting important areas of my life. Maybe it’s even hurting the relationship between me and this person. I share this so the friendship doesn’t take a turn for the worst.</p>
<p>Most people will understand and be sympathetic to a plight if you’re stretched too thin, though some may not. Which ever the case, hold your ground. If you know you need to step down to protect yourself, do it with a clear conscience.</p>
<p>In the end, it’s important to guard our relationships and health closely. Once we’ve lightened the load, we need to start working on ways to say no when our ego tells us to say yes.</p>

		<a href="https://jimmitchell.org/2019/11/09/its-your-first-dreamforce-what/" class="u-url"><time class="dt-published" datetime="2019-11-09 12:20:00 -0800">Nov 9, 2019</time></a>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Yay! It’s your first Dreamforce!</p>
<p>You’re pumped to finally be part of the magic. I bet you’ve already looked at a lot of other blogs to learn how to be ready before you landed here.</p>
<p>These are a few of my recommendations to make it a more memorable experience.</p>
<h2 id="comfortable-shoes">Comfortable Shoes</h2>
<p>You want to wear comfortable shoes your feet are already used to, so don’t buy what you plan to wear a couple of days in advance. Take your old, ratty sneakers if you have to. I even recommend bringing two pair of super-comfy shoes if you can. Trust me, your feet will thank you for it. Having two pair of shoes helps reduce foot fatigue and keeps you feeling refreshed all around.</p>
<p>You’ll do a lot of walking over the four or five days of Dreamforce (I logged over 40 miles last year), and your dogs are going to be really tired by the end of the first day. Keeping foot-fresh should be one of your top priorities.</p>
<p>Bring extra socks and change them during the day too. It’ll help, I promise.</p>
<h2 id="crowds-chaos-and-pandemonium">Crowds, Chaos and Pandemonium</h2>
<p>Rumor has it Salesforce reduced the number of attendees this year compared to last. Even if this is true, be ready for plenty of chaos and pandemonium. The entire Dreamforce campus will be really crowded, with most people looking at their mobile device to figure out where they’re going next, so pack your patience along with those shoes.</p>
<p>Some people will be friendly and some won’t. It’s just how it is. Deciding to be one of the friendly people now will go a long way to enjoying the whole experience.</p>
<p>Remember to smile at other people and maybe even strike up a conversation with a stranger or two while standing in a line. You never know who you might meet by chance.</p>
<h2 id="dont-overload-your-schedule">Don’t Overload Your Schedule</h2>
<p>My first year, I filled my schedule to the brim with all the great sessions I wanted to attend, and barely made half of them. Give yourself plenty of time to get to your next session. Remember; crowds, chaos and pandemonium, not just on the street, but in the hotels where sessions are held too.</p>
<p>Twenty minutes to get from one place to another is not nearly enough time unless those sessions are in the same hotel. Give yourself the time to get there and find a prime seat.</p>
<p>You should also have some empty time to just wander an area you’re interested in. The Admin, Developer or Expo halls have a lot to see. Having free time to stroll through them might open up some unexpected opportunities to learn something, or meet someone new.</p>
<h2 id="stay-hydrated-and-well-fed">Stay Hydrated and Well Fed</h2>
<p>It’s going to be easy to skip a meal or forget to drink water. Bring high-protein or complex carb, non-sugary snacks to keep the hangries at bay. It’ll go a long way to helping you retain the patience you’ll need.</p>
<p>Staying hydrated will help reduce headaches and fatigue too. There will be water stations all over the place… Use them!</p>
<h2 id="dont-carry-a-laptop">Don’t Carry a Laptop</h2>
<p>Unless you absolutely have to have it with you, leave your laptop at the hotel. I carried mine with me the first year I attended and only pulled it out of my bag once. It was more of a ball and chain than it was the tool I thought it would be.</p>
<p>Instead, carry an analog journal to take notes, or have a good note-taking app on your phone.</p>
<p>Our team will be using <a href="https://quip.com">Quip</a> to share session notes with each other this year. The app is so good it’s earned a permanent place on my phone’s home screen.</p>
<h2 id="dont-be-afraid-of-your-heroes">Don’t Be Afraid of Your Heroes</h2>
<p>If you cross paths with someone from the community who inspires you, take the opportunity to introduce yourself to them. Naturally, be polite when doing it and respect any conversations your hero may already be involved in, but by introducing yourself, you could be opening the door to a friendship or opportunity further down the line.</p>
<p>The community heroes are heroes for a reason – because they enjoy helping others learn and grow.</p>
<p>I crossed paths with <a href="https://twitter.com/MikeGerholdt">Mike Gerholdt</a> very much by chance my first Dreamforce and was totally star-struck. I wish I’d taken a few more minutes to chat with him than I did. Don’t have the same regret I do.</p>
<p>Say hello, thank them for inspiring you and ask them a few questions you’d like to know about them. Wrap it up by asking if you can connect with them on social media.</p>
<h2 id="keep-yourself-safe">Keep Yourself Safe</h2>
<p>There are many areas of San Francisco I’d call questionable when it comes to your safety, especially after dark. Don’t walk if you don’t have to. There will be plenty of Uber and Lyft in the city. Getting yourself into a questionable circumstance could be scary at best and harmful at worst.</p>
<p>Know your surroundings at all times and keep your head on a swivel.</p>
<h2 id="take-lots-of-pictures">Take Lots of Pictures</h2>
<p>Finally, take lots of pictures and share them with your friends and family, and on social media, using the #<a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/DF19">DF19 hashtag</a>. Your pictures will remind you of the magic you experienced and keep you pumped through the year until you get to go to your next Dreamforce.</p>
<p>Feel free to connect with me through social media in the menu above and let me know you’ll be at Dreamforce. I may not be a hero, but I do love connecting with other people who have a passion for Salesforce like I do. I might even know someone who can help you out. You never know…</p>
<p>Hope to see you there!</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>One of my earliest childhood memories is traumatic. At least it would seem traumatic to a three-and-a-half-year-old little boy. Though it didn’t turn out to be the end of the world, it seemed like hell when it happened. I still carry the memory with me more than a half-century later, so it damaged me on some level.</p>
<p>My family – mother, wicked step-father, newborn baby sister and me – were living in an old two-story house in Lancaster, California, which in the late 1960s was still mostly desert scrub and Joshua trees. We were located far enough away from everything else that it could be called the middle of nowhere. Today, a strip mall stands where the house once did.</p>
<p>We were so remote that my mother didn’t really pay attention to what I was getting into. She trusted I would not stray too far and everything would just work itself out. She had a newborn baby to worry about and didn’t give me the attention I probably should have gotten. With nothing to do and no watchful eye, I would wander the acre-sized property, trying to keep myself entertained. This ended up being a theme in my childhood.</p>
<p>One day, I thought I could make friends with the ants who had built a nest out in the open area far behind the house. I was fascinated by how they scurried back and forth, some appearing from the mound while others disappeared into it.</p>
<p>To make friends with them, it seemed I should get close and be down at their level. This meant I had to sit next to the mound. So I planted myself there on the ground, wearing my tan shorts, striped t-shirt and little red sneakers. When the first few ants crawled on me, I thought they were welcoming my invitation to be friends.</p>
<p>These were not your garden variety ants, mind you. They were those red and black kind that are nearly a quarter of an inch long with strong mandibles. These ants were big, fast, and as it turns out, very aggressive.</p>
<p>Before I knew it, I was covered with dozens of ants that saw me as a threat to their home. The hive sounded the alarm and went on the attack. First, I felt one bite, then a few more and several more soon after that. Before I knew it, my skin was on fire as the big red and black ants bit me over and over. They were all over me. No matter how hard I tried, I couldn’t get them all off my body. This was pain unlike any other in my short time on earth.</p>
<p>I got up from the ground in a panic and began stripping off my clothes as I ran toward the house screaming like a banshee. By the time I got to the back door, I was down to my underwear and little red sneakers, covered with big red welts. I ran upstairs where I found my mother nursing my half-sister. I’m sure the sight of her little boy bursting into the room practically naked with tears streaming down his face alarmed her.</p>
<p>She was able to calm me enough to get the story from me. She squished the few remaining ants she found in my hair, then broke out ointment to soothe the swollen bites. Her motherly attention dissolved my anxiety and I calmed down.</p>
<p>My mother and I reminisced about this many times over the years. We even talked about it the last time I saw her before she passed away. She always thought it was hilarious. I, however, remember it differently.</p>
<p>To this day, ants give me the heebie-jeebies – even the tiny black ones you see after leaving greasy or sugary food out. If I find even one ant crawling on me after sitting in the grass, I’ll start doing a very unmanly arm-flailing dance to get the critter off me as fast as I can.</p>
<p>I learned a big lesson that day… Don’t sit on an ant mound without knowing the consequences, because you might get eaten alive. It was the last and only time I did.</p>

			 <p>Eventually you use up every excuse in your book for not doing the thing you keep saying you’re going to do. You’ve procrastinated yourself into a corner and realize it’s either time to just do it, or finally forget about it and move on.</p>
<p>That’s me, sometimes…</p>
<p>I’ve had this blog for nearly 14 years. In all that time, I only have 11 posts to show for it. That’s less than one post per year, with the newest one being more than a year old. At one point, I had written dozens of posts. But like any good artist is prone to doing, I trashed most of them because I felt like they were fodder. I regret making that choice.</p>
<p>I’ve seriously slacked in my writing since, which is sad, because I’ve always enjoyed the process. To me, putting words down, then moving them around to communicate an idea is fun. When I get into a flow, the words come out and land on the page. I don’t have to struggle with what I’m trying to say. They’re just there all of a sudden. When I tell a story through my writing, I feel like I’ve created this thing that lives and breathes on its own.</p>
<p>To be truthful, I made a fatal mistake a few years back. Struggling to find my own voice, I began modeling my work after what other people were doing. However, since it wasn’t <em>my</em> voice, I began to believe what I had to say didn’t make a difference, so why should I even bother? This grew into the worst case of writer’s block there ever was in the history of man.</p>
<p>Well, probably not. I’m sure there have been worse cases by far better writers, but I became so utterly uninspired to write during the last five years that it literally hurt to even <em>think</em> about putting words down. The three posts I made in 2018 were not easy.</p>
<p>To make up for my lack of creativity, I found a great way to procrastinate – tweaking my WordPress theme about a hundred-gazillion times. It became all-consuming to get things just pixel perfect and then start over from scratch again. I’ve written and tweaked more CSS code than I’m willing to admit, though I have gotten pretty good at it. My site theme is practically everything I’ve ever imagined in my head at this point. I can’t improve on it much more, if at all.</p>
<p>So what do I do now?</p>
<p>Just write.</p>
<p>Now is the time to stop procrastinating and make something. It doesn’t require perfection. My work will get better with practice. It doesn’t need to have meaning or impart some deep zen-like wisdom to the reader. I just need to start getting the stuff in my head out into written word.</p>
<p>Here and now is the best place for it, so this is where I’ve decided to begin again.</p>
<p>What have you been putting off? Is now the time for you to start again too?</p>

			 <p>After nearly fifty years, I can still remember the first time I smoked a cigarette. It was early spring and my family lived on a farm in a semi-rural part of Colorado, a little north of Denver, at the foot of the Rocky Mountains.</p>
<p>I lived there with my mother, wicked step-father (I&rsquo;m not even sure they were married, to be honest) and little half-sister. The closest kid my age lived more than five miles away, so I had no one to play with. This meant I had to find ways to keep myself entertained. Most of them ended up being things little boys are not supposed to do. Left to my own devices, it&rsquo;s a wonder I lived through all of my escapades.</p>
<p>I was seven years old and had stolen a pack of my mom&rsquo;s Kool Menthol 100s. I had a pack of matches from somewhere (yes, I was a pyro too, but that&rsquo;s a post for another time) and thought I could smoke just like mom and wicked step-father did. After taking a pack from her carton in the refrigerator, I snuck outside and hid behind the juniper trees where I wouldn&rsquo;t be seen. I opened the pack, took the long cigarette out, put it between my lips, struck a match, lit up and took a big puff like I&rsquo;d seen the adults do.</p>
<p>Oddly enough, I wasn&rsquo;t repulsed by the taste. In fact, I actually liked it. I still remember the menthol sensation on my tongue. It had a little bit of burn to it, but the taste wasn&rsquo;t that bad. I felt very grown up.</p>
<p>Of course, my little boy brain didn&rsquo;t know you should inhale the smoke from a cigarette, which is probably good because I&rsquo;m sure if I had, I would have wound up puking my guts out behind the trees. Sometimes I wonder; if I had inhaled, would I have ended up picking up the habit nine years later, or would I have been turned off completely?</p>
<p>There were other experiments with smoking through my childhood, but none really stuck. I&rsquo;d smoke here and there and eventually lose interest.</p>
<p>Until the day I met Tracy. He had just moved into the neighborhood where my mother, step-sister and I were living (wicked step-father was long-gone now). I think he said he was from New York. He was my age but had already become a pack-a-day smoker. I vividly recall the summer evening he offered me a Marlboro Red from his hard pack box. You weren&rsquo;t cool if you smoked soft pack, you know. It had to be hard pack and it had to be Marlboro Reds.</p>
<p>I began taking him up on his offers of free cigarettes. Before I knew it, I was smoking every day, bumming cigarettes from friends whenever I could. Then the moment I knew I was hooked came: I wanted to smoke while I was alone.</p>
<p>My mother, being the spectacular parent she was, started buying my smokes for me, so I had a steady supply of my own stashed in the refrigerator. Her rationale was that she&rsquo;d rather I smoke openly instead of hiding it. I think she hoped I&rsquo;d come to hate the habit and give up. Well, thanks mom, that didn&rsquo;t quite work out as planned.</p>
<p>So at the tender age of sixteen, I became a confirmed pack-a-day smoker. All the other kids my age were doing it, so why not me too? The problem was, I really liked smoking. I knew I wasn&rsquo;t going to stop. Other kids did it to be cool. I did it to feed the nicotine addiction.</p>
<p>Twelve years went by, and then I met Pam.</p>
<p>I still see the moment from our very first date in my mind&rsquo;s eye. We were running across a busy street in downtown Santa Monica to get to the club where we were headed to see a band. In the middle of the street, the hard pack of Marlboro Lights fell to the ground from my shirt pocket with a loud <em>plop</em> sound. I bent down and picked them up. When we got to the sidewalk on the other side, she immediately told me &ldquo;<em>I don&rsquo;t date people who smoke.</em>&rdquo;</p>
<p>That was a punch to the face, but one I&rsquo;m glad I took. Naturally, I didn&rsquo;t light up on that date, or any other we had after that. We&rsquo;re still married 25 years later and she&rsquo;s my best friend. I made the choice to quit because of her and I&rsquo;m proud to say I haven&rsquo;t smoked a cigarette since before we were engaged.</p>
<p>I can remember a bunch of different cigarettes I smoked through my life, but thanks to someone who is very special to me, I can&rsquo;t remember the very last one. For that, I&rsquo;m forever grateful.</p>

			 <p>Life is so full of distractions. It seems everything is vying for our attention in one way or another these days, with most of it coming from our electronic gadgets.</p>
<p>If you take time to look up from your phone for a few minutes, you’ll find a sea of humanity with faces buried in their own device. It’s painful to watch.</p>
<p>Personally, I’ve come to a point where I’ve had it with the digital distractions in my life, so this is what I’ve done about it.</p>
<h2 id="i-removed-the-useless-apps-from-my-phone">I Removed the Useless Apps from My Phone</h2>
<p>There was a time I had more than four screens of apps on my iPhone. I know many people who have far more than that. I don’t know how they manage all those screens since I could barely cope with the number I had. I’d regularly forget where an app was, which would usually be somewhere on the third screen, beyond two other screens of mostly unused apps.</p>
<p>Though I wasn’t aware of it, I’d made a game out of shuffling apps around on my home screens, hoping to one day land on the perfect combination that made perfect sense and put the universe back in order. Honestly, I think most of the apps on my phone back then got moved around more often than they were ever used.</p>
<p>Once this dawned on me, I decided it was time to purge. The first order of business was to get rid of the useless time-wasting “social” apps. I removed them from my phone without hesitation, deciding if I want to spend time on Facebook, I’ll make time specifically for it. Now, I’m lucky if I look at the site more than three or four times a month. I don’t miss Facebook and could probably go without it entirely if I decided to. I only keep it around to stay in touch with extended family and old friends. I intentionally pared my “friend” list down to less than 50 people that I actually know too.</p>
<p>After nuking the useless apps, I started an experiment with the remaining by moving the ones I didn’t absolutely need to a “folder” on the second home screen. If I used an app more than a few times in a week, it got “unpacked” and promoted back to the first home screen. After a month of this, I ended up with just 16 apps on my first screen – including the four I’d left in the dock as “must-have” when I started.</p>
<p>For apps that I didn’t touch after two months, I completely removed them from the phone. I know if I ever need a particular app, I can download it again — where it will find its rightful place on the second screen with all of the other lesser-used apps.</p>
<p>I evaluate my home screen every few weeks now to demote or remove apps if I feel they’re not serving a purpose. This has helped me stay laser-focused when I’m using my phone.</p>
<h2 id="i-set-all-but-the-most-important-apps-to-a-badge-notification">I Set All But the Most Important Apps to a Badge Notification</h2>
<p>For the apps I keep on my phone, if I need to see a notification of some kind, I’ll set it to badge only. No sounds, vibrations, banners or alerts to distract me. I’ll check it on my schedule, thank you very much.</p>
<p>This includes email — both personal and work. I purposely decided I didn’t want up to the moment email notifications, and I’ve found it quite liberating. Now, when I see a badge on an app, maybe I’ll look at it, maybe I won’t. It pretty much depends on the number displayed on the badge whether I decide to act.</p>
<p>Of course, there are exceptions to this rule, but they are few. The Phone app obviously needs notifications — otherwise, my phone isn’t a phone. Same for goes for Messages. I communicate with my immediate family by text a lot, so I leave this notification enabled.</p>
<p>The only other notifications I allow are OmniFocus for task management and Fantastical for calendars. I definitely need to be on time for meetings and appointments, and I must complete my tasks on time too.</p>
<p>Finally, I turned on “Do Not Disturb” mode between the hours of 10pm and 6am — which is when I go to bed, and an hour after I get up. That first hour in the morning with no distractions helps me get focused on my day ahead.</p>
<p>If you’re a notification junkie like I was, it’s hard to get used to working this way. But if you give it some time, you’ll find you’re picking your phone up a lot less and getting a lot more done during the day.</p>
<p>Give it a try. You’ll feel less tethered to your phone, I promise.</p>
<h2 id="i-set-limits-on-use">I Set Limits on Use</h2>
<p>As a family, we’ve agreed to set limits on when and where electronic devices are acceptable. Never, ever can any one of us bring a phone to the table during a meal. This rule extends to restaurant outings too. Once a meal is on the table, all gadgets go away until after the last person finishes their meal.</p>
<p>If we’re in a family setting for the holidays or a birthday, all devices get put away in pockets and purses so we can spend time socializing face-to-face. It’s okay if a phone comes out for a photo or two, but if any family member gets caught zoning out on their phone, everyone else reminds them of the rule. It’s worked pretty well so far.</p>
<p>These are some of the ways I’ve started breaking the twitch to reach for my phone and check it. Sometimes I forget, but I find every day gets a little easier. If you’re looking to lessen your own digital distractions, give some of these a try yourself. You might find there’s a lot more going on around you than you realized.</p>

			 <p>Saying no can be one of the hardest things to do.</p>
<p>No to an exciting new project. No to a volunteer opportunity in the community or at church; no to the extra helping of food at a meal; no to bad habits we’ve carried around with us all our lives.</p>
<p>There’s tremendous power in saying no. When we have the courage to do it, we stop stretching ourselves too thin. We make more time for our families. We become healthier by defeating the temptation to eat the extra cookie. We break bad habits that have held us captive all our lives.</p>
<p>These small wins add up over time and give us the courage to say no when we should more often.</p>
<p>It’s okay to say no. It doesn’t mean you’re weak. It says you’re strong and willing to sacrifice for the important stuff.</p>
<p>It takes guts to say no.</p>
<p>I’m working hard to learn this habit. No extra projects; no outside distractions and commitments that burn me out and take me away from the family; no to using food to deal with stress; no to procrastination; no wasting time on things that don’t matter.</p>
<p>I’ve found it’s not easy. The temptation to give in is always there. I have to remind myself almost every day: “<em>Is this thing worth what it’s going to take away from something else?</em>”</p>
<p>When I’m able to stay the course, I make room for plenty of yes in my life. Yes to spending time with family and friends; yes to being more focused and in the moment; yes to being mindful of those around me; yes to being tolerant of others; yes to making my health a priority.</p>
<p>It takes a lot of effort to say no. But in the end the good that comes from it far outweighs the bad we’re able to leave behind.</p>

			 <p>I’ve been around long enough to know life moves in cycles.</p>
<p>Things that were new and exciting one day eventually become dull and boring the next. The pursuit of shiny objects and interesting paths quickly fall by the wayside before you realize it. We move from one thing to the next and then another in search of a quick thrill, because we’ve become instant gratification junkies.</p>
<p>What if, instead, we intentionally slowed our lives down? What if we deliberately chose to look at the world in wonder like we did when we were young? What if we took time out to play like we did when we were children? What if we stopped to listen to what’s going on inside instead of burying our faces in smart devices that make us dumb?</p>
<p>We spend our adult lives working, chasing dreams, and running after material possessions we think will make us happy. But let me ask you; in all of your pursuits, are you truly content?</p>
<p>Is your soul really at peace?</p>
<p>If there’s any hint of hesitation in your answer, it might be time to step back, take a look at the bigger picture, and find what really fulfills you.</p>
<p>Your time on this pale blue dot is finite. It would be a tragic waste to get to the end and say “<em>I wish I could have&hellip;</em>” Maybe today should be the day you stop spinning cycles on unnecessary things that don’t matter.</p>
<p>The choice is yours. It has been all along.</p>

			<h1><a href="https://jimmitchell.org/2014/10/15/passing-your-salesforce-adm-certification/">Passing Your Salesforce ADM201 Certification Exam</a></h1>
		

		<a href="https://jimmitchell.org/2014/10/15/passing-your-salesforce-adm-certification/" class="u-url"><time class="dt-published" datetime="2014-10-15 13:00:04 -0800">Oct 15, 2014</time></a>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>I passed the Salesforce ADM201 certification exam today. It’s been a five-year road to get here. From the first week I began working with Salesforce, I decided attaining certification was something I wanted to pursue.</p>
<p>Now that I’ve done it, I thought it might be good to share the things that helped me be successful with those looking to do the same.</p>
<h2 id="know-your-stuff">Know Your Stuff</h2>
<p>Your success or failure pretty much boils down to this… You’ve got to know your stuff or it’s never going to happen.</p>
<p>The Salesforce ADM201 certification exam is not a walk in the park. You’ll never pass it by just reading the online help, or taking online practice tests and studying flash cards — most of which are badly outdated, or just plain wrong.</p>
<p>You’re going to need to be familiar with just about every area of Salesforce and how it actually works — where and how you can do something, and where and why you can’t do something else.</p>
<p>This means getting a developer org and configuring it just like you would if you were doing it for your day job or a client. Be creative in your approach. Try doing things you’ve never done. Try to break it. Enter real data and learn how it flows through the system from a Campaign to a converted Lead to a resolved Case.</p>
<p>Learn it, live it, be it…</p>
<p>Do everything in your power to wrap your head around the big picture of what Salesforce does and totally understand it. That’s what being a good admin is all about anyway — knowing what can or can’t be done.</p>
<h2 id="study-with-a-group">Study With a Group</h2>
<p>I can’t stress this one enough.</p>
<p>My employer was kind enough to purchase a year of Premiere Plus Support in order to provide me the online courses to pursue certification, and I did all 60+ hours of both the ADM201 and DEV401 trainings. I learned a lot from it, but it wasn’t until I joined a study group that the learning really sank in.</p>
<p>Collaborating with a group of your peers introduces fresh ideas, which could give you a completely different perspective about a topic. That, in turn, leads to other moments of discovery. If you’re serious about earning a certification, I suggest you find others who are as committed as you to passing your exam.</p>
<p>I joined the Salesforce Certification Study Group<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> in the Salesforce Success Community. Deepa Patel and the others who volunteer with the group have worked hard to develop a successful curriculum with a high passing rate for those who are committed enough to make it to the end. It doesn’t cost any more than your time and effort, plus the $200 to register for your Salesforce ADM201 certification exam, which you’re going to spend anyway.</p>
<p>Once you’re accepted into the private group, watch what goes on in the Chatter feed for a while, then when signups for the next round of sessions are announced, join the one that best suits your geographical region.</p>
<h2 id="make-the-time">Make the Time</h2>
<p>Okay. You’ve been accepted into the study group. But if you aren’t totally serious about earning your certification, you’ll never be successful. Period. You’ve got to want it to happen. If you don’t give studying the attention it needs, you can forget about passing, and may as well stop reading now.</p>
<p>Make it what you think about when you’re sitting in traffic, brushing your teeth, or taking a shower. Turn off the TV for a couple hours each night and learn something new about Salesforce instead. Choose to become obsessed for a while.</p>
<p>If you end up joining the certification study group, make time to do the work you’re supposed to do before the next session — every single week. Commit to the 15 weeks the group is going to require from you. Be ready to demo your work for the online sessions. Know exactly what you did, why you did it, and have a reason for it. I promise you’ll learn incredible amounts if you commit to working this way.</p>
<h2 id="be-real-with-yourself">Be Real with Yourself</h2>
<p>Be 100% honest with yourself. Ask yourself “Am I <em>really</em> ready to pursue certification?” If you’ve only been working with Salesforce a few months, it’s going to be a tough row to hoe, even with the help and support of a study group — who may not be too keen helping you along while studying themselves.</p>
<p>Being part of a group requires commitment. People are depending on you to have ideas that could be different than theirs. Are you <em>really</em> ready to commit to a group of 6–12 people for 15 weeks, and collaborate with them? Are you <em>really</em> ready to do 5 to 8 hours of homework each week? It’s going to take serious sacrifice.</p>
<p>If you’re not ready, then wait until you are. You have a better chance of succeeding if you do. By joining the study group without enough experience, chances are you’ll fall behind fast, which is going to discourage you. Don’t set yourself up to fail. Be ready.</p>
<h2 id="use-good-resources">Use Good Resources</h2>
<p>I mentioned the online tests and flash cards earlier. Don’t rely on them at all. Salesforce adds lots of new features at each release. Flash cards and tests from the Spring ’11 release are full of misinformation now. If you rely on them to know your stuff, you might not know much at all.</p>
<p>There is one good resource I’ll personally endorse, and that’s John Coppedge’s <a href="http://certifiedondemand.com/">Certified On Demand</a>.</p>
<p>I joined while John was developing the site, but would have no hesitation spending the $40 lifetime membership that he’s asking for now. It’s a good resource that’s kept current. The questions he’s developed are quite similar to the real test (but not actual questions, and are just a little easier).</p>
<p>Consider supporting John’s efforts and buying a lifetime membership. Use Certified On Demand as a supplement to studying with the Salesforce Certification Study Group. It helped me be confident I was ready when I started doubting myself.</p>
<p>The only other resource you need now is to watch the Dreamforce Get Started on the Certified Administrator Credential<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup> workshop video. It provides solid advice for being ready, how to take the Salesforce ADM201 certification exam, and knowing what you’re walking into.</p>
<h2 id="taking-your-exam">Taking Your Exam</h2>
<p>You’ve scheduled your test, and now it’s time to go take it.</p>
<p>There’s only one thing to be said… Know that you know what you know. If you’ve worked hard in the Salesforce Certification Study Group, you’re ready to pass. Walk into the exam knowing that fact.</p>
<p>When you sit down to begin, take a minute to breathe and relax. Then start your exam using the techniques you learned from the workshop video. Before you know it, you’ll be waking out of the testing center as a Salesforce Certified Administrator.</p>

			<h1><a href="https://jimmitchell.org/2014/07/23/salesforce-flows-visualforce-and-record/">Salesforce Flows, Visualforce and Record Context</a></h1>
		

		<a href="https://jimmitchell.org/2014/07/23/salesforce-flows-visualforce-and-record/" class="u-url"><time class="dt-published" datetime="2014-07-23 15:15:24 -0800">Jul 23, 2014</time></a>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>I was asked to find a solution for our field reps that would simplify the process of adding a completed task to their activities when they visited one of our retail stores.</p>
<p>We keep our retail locations in Salesforce.com as contacts under a master account, which is shared with all users using a special account sharing rule.</p>
<p>The solution I came up with was a simple flow that limited users to a specific set of enterable information, pre-filling the date of the activity, and marking the task complete when the activity was committed. Literally, the only thing they needed to do was select a picklist value and enter a comment about their visit. It was exactly what we were looking for.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>The thing I didn’t like about the flow was that when a user entered it, context kind of got lost – meaning they started out from a contact record, but didn’t have a good visual cue about where they were once they got into the flow.</p>
<p>Sure, the flow was simple, but to me it’s still poor UX not to know the context of your work at all times. So, I decided to use a Visualforce page to solve the problem:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-html" data-lang="html">&lt;<span style="color:#f92672">apex:page</span> <span style="color:#a6e22e">standardController</span><span style="color:#f92672">=</span><span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;Contact&#34;</span>&gt;

    &lt;<span style="color:#f92672">flow:interview</span> <span style="color:#a6e22e">name</span><span style="color:#f92672">=</span><span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;Retail_Store_Visit&#34;</span>&gt;

        &lt;<span style="color:#f92672">apex:param</span> <span style="color:#a6e22e">name</span><span style="color:#f92672">=</span><span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;vAccount&#34;</span> <span style="color:#a6e22e">value</span><span style="color:#f92672">=</span><span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;{!Contact.Account.Id}&#34;</span>&gt;&lt;/<span style="color:#f92672">apex:param</span>&gt;
    &lt;/<span style="color:#f92672">flow:interview</span>&gt;
&lt;/<span style="color:#f92672">apex:page</span>&gt;
</code></pre></div><p>The trouble with this was that after the flow data was committed, the user would be returned to the beginning of the flow. That’s definitely not what I wanted. I needed to go back to the contact record I started from.</p>
<p>So I added the <code>finishLocation</code> attribute to the <code>&lt;flow:interview /&gt;</code> component tag. It would make sense that if I passed the Contact Id, the flow should return to the Contact record:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-html" data-lang="html">&lt;<span style="color:#f92672">flow:interview</span> <span style="color:#a6e22e">name</span><span style="color:#f92672">=</span><span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;Retail_Store_Visit&#34;</span> <span style="color:#a6e22e">finishLocation</span><span style="color:#f92672">=</span><span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;{!URLFOR(&#39;/&#39; + Contact.Id)}&#34;</span>&gt;
    &lt;<span style="color:#f92672">apex:param</span> <span style="color:#a6e22e">name</span><span style="color:#f92672">=</span><span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;vContact&#34;</span> <span style="color:#a6e22e">value</span><span style="color:#f92672">=</span><span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;{!Contact.Id}&#34;</span>&gt;&lt;/<span style="color:#f92672">apex:param</span>&gt;
    &lt;<span style="color:#f92672">apex:param</span> <span style="color:#a6e22e">name</span><span style="color:#f92672">=</span><span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;vAccount&#34;</span> <span style="color:#a6e22e">value</span><span style="color:#f92672">=</span><span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;{!Contact.Account.Id}&#34;</span>&gt;&lt;/<span style="color:#f92672">apex:param</span>&gt;
&lt;/<span style="color:#f92672">flow:interview</span>&gt;
</code></pre></div><p>Nope. That didn’t do it. When the flow is entered, context gets lost, so Salesforce doesn’t really know where the user is anymore. Even using the <code>vContact</code> Apex parameter didn’t work.</p>
<p>I searched help documentation for an answer, but it wasn’t all that helpful. I searched Communities and came up empty. Then I searched the <a href="http://salesforce.stackexchange.com/">Salesforce Stack Exchange</a>, where the only solution I could find was really convoluted, and didn’t even come close to solving my problem. I was vexed.</p>
<p>Taking a break to get a cup of coffee, a solution dawned on me that turned out to be pretty darned simple. All I needed was an Apex variable in the page, which I could pass to the <code>finishLocation</code> component tag once the flow was complete. Oddly enough, this method is not documented – at least not that I could find.</p>
<p>So…the final Visualforce page:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-html" data-lang="html">&lt;<span style="color:#f92672">apex:page</span> <span style="color:#a6e22e">standardController</span><span style="color:#f92672">=</span><span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;Contact&#34;</span>&gt;

			 <p>I’ve been working on a force.com app with the requirement that a user must enter a valid email address on a Visualforce page before being able to save a record.</p>
<p>But they must also be able to insert the related contact’s email address by clicking a button instead of having to leave the edit page to go find it. That seemed simple enough, but it wasn’t. This is my solution for making a field appear required on a Visualforce page.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>In my original Visualforce page, it seemed logical that if I set the recipient email field as required, all would work as expected. However, defining the field as required prevented my custom action in my page controller from firing and entering the email address.</p>

</code></pre></div><p>In this example, the <code>fillEmail()</code> action should select the related contact email address, and put the value in the <code>Recipient_Email__c</code> field so the user can see it.</p>
<p>But it’s not that simple it seems. When the field had the <code>required=“true”</code> attribute set, the action would not fire because all validation is done on the client side and the page never posts back to the server — so the controller action never gets called.</p>
<p>So after some digging and asking for help on the Salesforce discussion boards, the solution was to make the <code>Recipient_Email__c</code> appear as if it’s required on the page (though it’s really not), and add a new save method to my controller to handle field validation on the server side when the record gets saved.</p>

</code></pre></div><p>Notice the <code>&lt;apex:pageblocksectionitem /&gt;</code> code to replace the original field. This is how we make the field appear with the “required” bar. A nifty trick that took some digging to discover. Hopefully, this post saves someone else the time it took me to figure it out — and me the time when I forget it.</p>
<p>For convenience, here’s a <a href="https://gist.github.com/jimmitchell/4595878">Github Gist</a> with field label &amp; inline help that shows exactly how to make a field appear required on a Visualforce page.</p>

			 <p>I had the need to add a bunch of named text files to a folder in the Finder on my Mac today.</p>
<p>I found it a pain to open BBEdit, make a new document, save it to where I wanted it, and then manually copy &amp; rename the file back in the Finder. A lot of effort just to get 7 or 8 empty files with different names.</p>
<p>So, I threw together this little AppleScript to add empty files instead. The gist is once launched in the Finder (using <a href="http://www.red-sweater.com/fastscripts/">FastScripts</a> by <a href="http://www.red-sweater.com/">Red Sweater</a> naturally. Keystroke: cmd+option+shift+N), a dialog pops up that lets you enter a file title. Then the Finder creates that file in the front-most window. If no window is open, the file is added to your Desktop.</p>
<p>I found this to be more than twice as fast as the “traditional” method of making several files. Hopefully, it can help you out too. Remember, use it with <a href="http://www.red-sweater.com/fastscripts/">FastScripts</a> for quick keystroke access. Save as a script in the “Finder” scripts folder <code>(“~/Library/Scripts/Applications/Finder/”)</code>.</p>

			 <p>Some time ago, I set up my Gmail account in Apple Mail to copy over messages which were not sent to my jimmitchell.org account. I’m one of those guys who likes to have everything all in one place at my fingertips when I need it.</p>
<p>After copying over the messages I wanted, I completely removed the Gmail IMAP account from Mail and went about my business. Soon after, when I went searching for a specific email, I experienced the phenomenon of ghost emails in the search results.</p>
<p>These are messages that Mail once knew about, but no longer knows where they exist. The ghost emails were all from the since removed Gmail account.</p>
<p>If you’re experiencing the same problem, here’s a very simple fix to rebuild the Apple Mail envelope index.</p>
<p>First, quit Apple Mail if it’s running, then navigate your way to <code>~/Library/Mail/</code> (where &ldquo;~&rdquo; is your home folder) in the Finder. Once you’re in the Mail folder, you’ll see a file named “Envelope Index” which keeps track of where all messages are located. Rename “Envelope Index” to “Envelope Index Backup” (We don’t want to trash the file just yet).</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Then, relaunch Apple Mail. You’ll be presented with a daunting “Message Import” dialog that looks like your email account was wiped out and you’re starting all over. Fear not. You’re simply rebuilding the Envelope Index at this point.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Click &ldquo;Continue&rdquo; to rebuild the index. Once it’s done, all those pesky phantom messages will be gone the next time you perform a search in Mail (Yay!). You can then go back to the <code>~/Library/Mail/</code> folder in the Finder and move the file you renamed to &ldquo;Envelope Index Backup&rdquo; to the Trash.</p>
<p>And there it is. Your Apple Mail Envelope index has been rebuilt. A very simple solution to a problem that has baffled some of the best Mac users.</p>
