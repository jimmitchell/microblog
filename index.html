			<h1><a href="https://jimmitchell.dev/2024/04/02/macbook-air-m.html">MacBook Air M3 15&#34; First Impressions</a></h1>
		

		<a href="https://jimmitchell.dev/2024/04/02/macbook-air-m.html" class="u-url"><time class="dt-published" datetime="2024-04-02 07:57:02 -0700">Apr 2, 2024</time></a>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>My initial thoughts on the MacBook Air M3 15&quot; fully spec&rsquo;d model&hellip;</p>
<ul>
<li>The size, weight and form factor are perfect for me. I love my 13&quot; M1, but I like the 15&quot; M3 more. Typing feels less cramped for my big hands.</li>
<li>Though the M3 is a mere 1/10th of a pound lighter, there seems to be even more of a weight difference between the two. Probably because of the larger overall footprint.</li>
<li>I like the screen much better. At 500 nits vs. 300 for the M1, the screen pops more at full brightness. As a former design artist, this is important to me.</li>
<li>The body has no micro-holes for speakers. I love this. My day job 16&quot; MacBook Pro does, and all kinds of dust gets stuck in the tiny holes. I plan to do some sound comparisons between the M1 and M3 tonight.</li>
<li>The notch was noticeable when I first started setting it up, but after a while it sort of faded into the background. Thankfully <a href="https://www.macbartender.com">Bartender 5&rsquo;s</a> menu bar styles helped with this.</li>
<li>Having a MagSafe charger again is great. I always thought that was a brilliant design and was sad when Apple moved away from it. I&rsquo;m happy to see MagSafe making a comeback. Plus it opens up an extra USB-C port.</li>
<li>I like the smaller screen bezel. It makes the screen feel bigger than it really is.</li>
<li>It&rsquo;s fast. I&rsquo;m glad I got the top spec.</li>
<li>Sadly, it&rsquo;s just a little too wide for my favorite Crumpler messenger bag I&rsquo;ve had for 15+ years. I see a replacement purchase in the near future here.</li>
</ul>
<p>All in all, after just a few hours of use, it&rsquo;s a <a href="https://www.apple.com/macbook-air/">buy</a> I&rsquo;m pleased with. More thoughts to come in the next week or two.</p>

			 <p>Events happen in our lives that make us do a full stop and give a long, hard look at how things are. This was one of those events that slapped me in the face so hard I&rsquo;m still having a hard time grasping it.</p>
<p>About a week ago, I had a heart related event that sent me to the emergency room. It was serious enough that the doctor point blank told me it could have been deadly had I not paid attention to it.</p>
<p>When I woke up at 3:30 am last Thursday, my heart was palpitating and racing at over 150 bpm. I thought for sure I was having a heart attack. I woke my wife and we sped to the closest ER (she drove).</p>
<p>When the doctor examined me, my heart was in an state of Afib (<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/atrial-fibrillation/symptoms-causes/syc-20350624">atrial fibrillation</a>). They pumped me full of drugs to bring my heart below 100 bpm and hopefully put me back into a sinus rhythm. They were able to get the heart rate down a little, but it fluctuated between 90 and 120 bpm for hours. They weren&rsquo;t able to get me back into a sinus rhythm either.</p>
<p>Ultimately, I was admitted to the hospital. My heart finally went back into a sinus rhythm after 19 very exhausting hours. After several tests, the cardiologist was able to determine this is a defect I&rsquo;ve had all my life. I&rsquo;d had small episodes as long as I can remember, but never thought anything of it. It&rsquo;s forcing some big changes to my lifestyle. Thankfully, I&rsquo;m still here to write about it.</p>
<p>The most terrible and heartbreaking part of this story is that another man, just a year younger than me (having overheard his age), was put into the ER bed right next to me complaining of excruciating back pain. Like me, he walked in under his own power. Within 30 minutes of arrival, he went unresponsive and ultimately passed away from heart failure. The ER staff worked furiously to bring him back for a long time. At one point he did resuscitate, but before they could get him to the ICU, he crashed again. There was nothing they could do for this man. So tragic.</p>
<p>This all happened right next to my wife and I before we knew what was going on with my own heart. It scared the living shit out of both of us, and I&rsquo;ll never, ever forget it.</p>
<p>Life is <em>really</em> fucking short and can be taken from you in a heartbeat &ndash; literally.</p>
<p>I should not be living to work. I should be working to live a full life with &ndash; and for &ndash; those most important to me. It&rsquo;s easy to get wrapped up in a career. To hell with that now! Family and friends are what matter. And so does living a life that makes a difference to them. It took nearly six decades to see it clearly. I&rsquo;m grateful I was shown the lesson with enough time to do something about it.</p>
<p>No matter what, hold your loved ones close. Let them know you love them every day. Patch the broken relationships even though it&rsquo;s hard. Live each day with gratitude and wonder, because you could be gone in a matter of moments.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>I planned on publishing a post like this myself, but <a href="https://micro.blog/canion">@canion</a> beat me to the punch, <a href="https://canion.blog/2023/12/03/my-mac-apps.html">getting his out first</a>&hellip; I&rsquo;m going to use the same criteria he uses for making the cut:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>For my purposes, to be considered an App of the Year, the software needs to be something I used extensively, value and enjoy. I also must feel I would miss them if they suddenly went away. Of course, it also needs to be a Mac App.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Without further ado, my list of the top five&hellip;</p>
<h3 id="launchbar">LaunchBar</h3>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been using <a href="https://obdev.at/products/launchbar/index.html">LaunchBar</a> since 2005, probably longer than any other Mac app I currently use, save BBEdit. I set up my wife&rsquo;s old 2012 27&quot; iMac last week to install macOS Sonoma via <a href="https://dortania.github.io/OpenCore-Legacy-Patcher/">OpenCore Legacy Patcher</a>, and through each step, I found my muscle memory wanting to launch some app with LaunchBar. I easily use this app a hundred times a day, every day.</p>
<h3 id="fantastical">Fantastical</h3>
<p>I live and die by my calendar these days. For me, the only calendar application worthy of being used on a Mac is <a href="https://flexibits.com/fantastical">Fantastical</a>, hands-down. The natural language input is super useful and slick. The premium feature I love the most is Openings. For my work, I&rsquo;ve got too many people wanting to meet with me for this or that. All I have to do is give them a URL and tell them to find an opening. This has saved me hours. I hate subscriptions, but to me, this app is worth it.</p>
<h3 id="safari">Safari</h3>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been a Chrome user for many years now. But, two things made me change to Safari this year. First, Chrome has become a memory hog. As I write this, for the same five tabs open, Chrome is using 235MB of memory among 45 threads, whereas Safari is only using 151MB across 10 threads. Less memory and thread usage means better battery life. Second is the privacy philosophies between Apple and Google. Enough said on that one.</p>
<h3 id="ivory">Ivory</h3>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been on Mastodon since 2018, but as the platform becomes more popular and my use picks up, I find myself leaning more and more on <a href="https://tapbots.com/ivory/">Ivory</a>. I started out with Mona as my Mastodon client &ndash; which is a great app too &ndash; but I just find myself gravitating more and more to Ivory. I can&rsquo;t put my finger on why. It&rsquo;s just the one I prefer between the two.</p>
<h3 id="bbedit">BBEdit</h3>
<p>Parts of my job require me to transform and manipulate large amounts of data in all kinds of ways. When it comes to a text editor (for .csv files), <a href="http://www.barebones.com/products/bbedit/index.html">BBEdit</a> is <em>the</em> application of choice for me. I&rsquo;ve been using BBEdit since version 1.0, even longer than I&rsquo;ve been using LaunchBar. I&rsquo;d die without this app. For me, it&rsquo;s worth the $30 upgrade every few years. If you&rsquo;re a long-time Mac user, you know what BBEdit is and what it&rsquo;s capable of.</p>
<h3 id="apps-that-fell-off-the-list">Apps That Fell Off the List</h3>
<p>Since this is the first year of my list, I can&rsquo;t really say what fell off the prior, but these are the apps I&rsquo;ve found myself using less and less over the last year or two.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Reeder</strong> - in favor of <a href="https://netnewswire.com">NetNewsWire</a>. Both are really great apps, and I&rsquo;m flopping back and forth between the two right now, but NetNewsWire is slightly edging out Reeder.</li>
<li><strong>Google Chrome</strong> - in favor of Safari, obviously.</li>
<li><strong>Agenda</strong> - I like the calendar integration of Agenda, but like <a href="https://micro.blog/canion">@canion</a>, I&rsquo;m leaning more towards <a href="https://obisidan.md">Obsidian</a> for note taking as of late.</li>

<p>I&rsquo;m excited to share I&rsquo;ve released a new version of my <a href="https://micro.blog/account/plugins/view/101">Tinylytics for Micro.blog</a> plugin, bringing it to version 3.1.0. You should see an update in your site&rsquo;s plugins section soon if not already.</p>
<p>This release adds features to link back to your public stats page on Tinylytics if you have it enabled, and show a webring avatar on the footer embed code if you so choose.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve also created a <a href="https://jimmitchell.org/tinylytics-for-microblog/">dedicated page</a> that explains the plugin&rsquo;s options, how to use it, as well as providing some examples for styling the footer embed to get you going for your own site.</p>
<p>The plugin is of course free to use, but if you find it worth supporting, donations can be made via my <a href="https://ko-fi.com/jimmitchellmedia">Ko-fi</a> page.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>There&rsquo;s a lot of hubbub in the news and online about the &ldquo;new Beatles song&rdquo; that dropped yesterday. As a life-long semi-pro musician, this headline hits a sour note with me. Hah! See what I did there?</p>
<p>Anyway, my thoughts&hellip;</p>
<p>This song was one of many demos Lennon did after the band broke up. This is key. While we don&rsquo;t know for sure, it&rsquo;s unlikely he said to himself &ldquo;<em>This would be a great Beatles song. I should ring up the lads.</em>&rdquo; when composing the tune.</p>
<p>Lennon&rsquo;s widow &ldquo;gave&rdquo;<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> the demo tapes to the remaining Beatles <em>years</em> after his tragic murder and even longer after the band had officially broke up. The tape Yoko turned over is purported to contain at least three of Lennon&rsquo;s demos<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup>, not just this one song.</p>
<p>Paul, George, and Ringo messed around with the recording, laying down all new tracks for the song. I&rsquo;m sure they did this with the other demo songs too<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup>. But that&rsquo;s all it is; they messed around with a demo of their deceased former bandmate. Lennon was not there to collaborate as a band member. Releasing a song as a &ldquo;band&rdquo; means all members have provided input on the final product. This fact alone makes the song <em>not</em> a Beatles song.</p>
<p>Fast forward 25 years. Now we have machine learning that can digitally enhance anyone&rsquo;s voice, and even reproduce a near perfect representation of vocals from unrelated sample files. This is how Lennon&rsquo;s lyrics were included in the song &ndash; by digitally reproducing and enhancing something that was barely audible to begin with. Ultimately, these are not Lennon&rsquo;s true vocals. They are a damn good representation of the man&rsquo;s voice enhanced by computers<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup>.</p>
<p>The use of AI bodes poorly for musicians who create their art. Will we start seeing demos of other bands which were never intended to see the light of day getting released by record labels as &ldquo;the lost album of (band name here)&rdquo;? I bet we will. We already are. As a result, the soul of recorded music is lost and it&rsquo;s just become about the money for record labels.</p>
<p>The list of credits for this song is long. But in the end, it&rsquo;s still just a well (over?) produced John Lennon demo and not a Beatles recording. He is the only &ldquo;songwriter&rdquo; who I believe should be credited.</p>
<section class="footnotes" role="doc-endnotes">
<hr>
<ol>
<li id="fn:1" role="doc-endnote">
<p>I have a hard time believing Yoko simply &ldquo;gave&rdquo; anything to the remaining Beatles. My suspicion is there had to be money involved somehow&hellip;&#160;<a href="#fnref:1" class="footnote-backref" role="doc-backlink">&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;</a></p>
</li>
<li id="fn:2" role="doc-endnote">
<p>&ldquo;Free as a Bird&rdquo; and &ldquo;Real Love&rdquo; were recorded as demos by Lennon before his death in 1980 and completed by the surviving Beatles in 1995 while Harrison was still alive.&#160;<a href="#fnref:2" class="footnote-backref" role="doc-backlink">&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;</a></p>
</li>
<li id="fn:3" role="doc-endnote">
<p>Of course they did since &ldquo;Free as a Bird&rdquo; and &ldquo;Real Love&rdquo; were released as Beatles songs, which I honestly was not aware of until now.&#160;<a href="#fnref:3" class="footnote-backref" role="doc-backlink">&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;</a></p>
</li>
<li id="fn:4" role="doc-endnote">
<p>This is what chaps my hide the most about this song being released. Using AI to digitally restore a vocal is even worse that using auto-tune.&#160;<a href="#fnref:4" class="footnote-backref" role="doc-backlink">&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;</a></p>

<p>Here are the top reasons why I decided to switch back&hellip;</p>
<ul>
<li>I find it easier to follow conversations in a dedicated Mastodon app on both desktop and mobile. Mona is my favorite.</li>
<li>There will be times when I have something to say, but may not want to post it to Micro.blog.</li>
<li>I have a separate WordPress blog that allows Mastodon users to connect with me. I&rsquo;d totally forgotten about that site.</li>
<li>I find connecting with Mastodon users easier on that platform.</li>

			 <p>The move from a (slow as hell) shared hosting half way around the world in the UK to my own Digital Ocean VPS located in San Francisco is complete, as is the move to a new domain. All in all, a few days to accomplish with all the server tweaks and getting the old domains to redirect to the new one. I&rsquo;m happy with the results. Now it&rsquo;s time to get writing again!</p>

			 <p>I woke up this morning to a Twitter notification that SMS MFA will only be for Twitter Blue subscribers soon. So typical of the Space Karen.

			 <p>The final straw has been drawn with Twitter. Elon Musk cutting off API access to 3rd party Twitter clients without warning is a cunt move. I usually won&rsquo;t use language like that, but I call them as I see them and Elon Musk has 100% proven himself to be a cunt. Goodbye, Twitter. You could have been something used for change, but your new owner is nothing but a fucking moron.</p>
