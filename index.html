			 <p>After <em>decades</em> as a Mac user, I <em>just now</em> discovered <strong>cmd + =</strong> (cmd + equals) and <strong>cmd + -</strong> (cmd + minus) increase and decrease icon preview sizes in a Finder window. Where the heck have I been? 🤯</p>

			 <p>Woohoo! Surprised to have gotten the initial email from the WordPress plugin review team on my Tinylytics plugin today. Lots of things to fix, but they’re all pretty simple. TBH, the review came back better than I thought it would for being my first attempt at a WordPress plugin.</p>

			 <p>I type (abuse) ellipses so much, my keyboard at work has taken to adding double periods to sentences for me, forcing me to delete one of the periods.. Or maybe it&rsquo;s simply encouraging me to end all of my sentences with an ellipsis? One may never know&hellip;</p>

			 <p>Well friends, I’m sorry to report — or maybe I’m relieved to report — that Project Yeard has officially terminated at the fourth month. The last two weeks have been a challenge, but I waited until a good beard day before doing the chop to be sure of my choice. It was the right one to make.</p>

			 <p>I planned on publishing a post like this myself, but <a href="https://micro.blog/canion">@canion</a> beat me to the punch, <a href="https://canion.blog/2023/12/03/my-mac-apps.html">getting his out first</a>&hellip; I&rsquo;m going to use the same criteria he uses for making the cut:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>For my purposes, to be considered an App of the Year, the software needs to be something I used extensively, value and enjoy. I also must feel I would miss them if they suddenly went away. Of course, it also needs to be a Mac App.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Without further ado, my list of the top five&hellip;</p>
<h3 id="launchbar">LaunchBar</h3>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been using <a href="https://obdev.at/products/launchbar/index.html">LaunchBar</a> since 2005, probably longer than any other Mac app I currently use, save BBEdit. I set up my wife&rsquo;s old 2012 27&quot; iMac last week to install macOS Sonoma via <a href="https://dortania.github.io/OpenCore-Legacy-Patcher/">OpenCore Legacy Patcher</a>, and through each step, I found my muscle memory wanting to launch some app with LaunchBar. I easily use this app a hundred times a day, every day.</p>
<h3 id="fantastical">Fantastical</h3>
<p>I live and die by my calendar these days. For me, the only calendar application worthy of being used on a Mac is <a href="https://flexibits.com/fantastical">Fantastical</a>, hands-down. The natural language input is super useful and slick. The premium feature I love the most is Openings. For my work, I&rsquo;ve got too many people wanting to meet with me for this or that. All I have to do is give them a URL and tell them to find an opening. This has saved me hours. I hate subscriptions, but to me, this app is worth it.</p>
<h3 id="safari">Safari</h3>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been a Chrome user for many years now. But, two things made me change to Safari this year. First, Chrome has become a memory hog. As I write this, for the same five tabs open, Chrome is using 235MB of memory among 45 threads, whereas Safari is only using 151MB across 10 threads. Less memory and thread usage means better battery life. Second is the privacy philosophies between Apple and Google. Enough said on that one.</p>
<h3 id="ivory">Ivory</h3>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been on Mastodon since 2018, but as the platform becomes more popular and my use picks up, I find myself leaning more and more on <a href="https://tapbots.com/ivory/">Ivory</a>. I started out with Mona as my Mastodon client &ndash; which is a great app too &ndash; but I just find myself gravitating more and more to Ivory. I can&rsquo;t put my finger on why. It&rsquo;s just the one I prefer between the two.</p>
<h3 id="bbedit">BBEdit</h3>
<p>Parts of my job require me to transform and manipulate large amounts of data in all kinds of ways. When it comes to a text editor (for .csv files), <a href="http://www.barebones.com/products/bbedit/index.html">BBEdit</a> is <em>the</em> application of choice for me. I&rsquo;ve been using BBEdit since version 1.0, even longer than I&rsquo;ve been using LaunchBar. I&rsquo;d die without this app. For me, it&rsquo;s worth the $30 upgrade every few years. If you&rsquo;re a long-time Mac user, you know what BBEdit is and what it&rsquo;s capable of.</p>
<h3 id="apps-that-fell-off-the-list">Apps That Fell Off the List</h3>
<p>Since this is the first year of my list, I can&rsquo;t really say what fell off the prior, but these are the apps I&rsquo;ve found myself using less and less over the last year or two.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Reeder</strong> - in favor of <a href="https://netnewswire.com">NetNewsWire</a>. Both are really great apps, and I&rsquo;m flopping back and forth between the two right now, but NetNewsWire is slightly edging out Reeder.</li>
<li><strong>Google Chrome</strong> - in favor of Safari, obviously.</li>
<li><strong>Agenda</strong> - I like the calendar integration of Agenda, but like <a href="https://micro.blog/canion">@canion</a>, I&rsquo;m leaning more towards <a href="https://obisidan.md">Obsidian</a> for note taking as of late.</li>

			 <p>By the time our hot water adventure is over tomorrow (oh I hope), it will be eight days and $1300 dollars 🪟💸, with that cost going to bring the new hot water heater up to code and the cost of a motel room so my household could take showers. Thankfully my home warranty covers the new hardware cost.</p>

		<a href="https://jimmitchell.dev/2023/11/03/the-beatles-song.html" class="u-url"><time class="dt-published" datetime="2023-11-03 08:29:39 -0800">Nov 3, 2023</time></a>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>There&rsquo;s a lot of hubbub in the news and online about the &ldquo;new Beatles song&rdquo; that dropped yesterday. As a life-long semi-pro musician, this headline hits a sour note with me. Hah! See what I did there?</p>
<p>Anyway, my thoughts&hellip;</p>
<p>This song was one of many demos Lennon did after the band broke up. This is key. While we don&rsquo;t know for sure, it&rsquo;s unlikely he said to himself &ldquo;<em>This would be a great Beatles song. I should ring up the lads.</em>&rdquo; when composing the tune.</p>
<p>Lennon&rsquo;s widow &ldquo;gave&rdquo;<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> the demo tapes to the remaining Beatles <em>years</em> after his tragic murder and even longer after the band had officially broke up. The tape Yoko turned over is purported to contain at least three of Lennon&rsquo;s demos<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup>, not just this one song.</p>
<p>Paul, George, and Ringo messed around with the recording, laying down all new tracks for the song. I&rsquo;m sure they did this with the other demo songs too<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup>. But that&rsquo;s all it is; they messed around with a demo of their deceased former bandmate. Lennon was not there to collaborate as a band member. Releasing a song as a &ldquo;band&rdquo; means all members have provided input on the final product. This fact alone makes the song <em>not</em> a Beatles song.</p>
<p>Fast forward 25 years. Now we have machine learning that can digitally enhance anyone&rsquo;s voice, and even reproduce a near perfect representation of vocals from unrelated sample files. This is how Lennon&rsquo;s lyrics were included in the song &ndash; by digitally reproducing and enhancing something that was barely audible to begin with. Ultimately, these are not Lennon&rsquo;s true vocals. They are a damn good representation of the man&rsquo;s voice enhanced by computers<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup>.</p>
<p>The use of AI bodes poorly for musicians who create their art. Will we start seeing demos of other bands which were never intended to see the light of day getting released by record labels as &ldquo;the lost album of (band name here)&rdquo;? I bet we will. We already are. As a result, the soul of recorded music is lost and it&rsquo;s just become about the money for record labels.</p>
<p>The list of credits for this song is long. But in the end, it&rsquo;s still just a well (over?) produced John Lennon demo and not a Beatles recording. He is the only &ldquo;songwriter&rdquo; who I believe should be credited.</p>
<section class="footnotes" role="doc-endnotes">
<hr>
<ol>
<li id="fn:1" role="doc-endnote">
<p>I have a hard time believing Yoko simply &ldquo;gave&rdquo; anything to the remaining Beatles. My suspicion is there had to be money involved somehow&hellip;&#160;<a href="#fnref:1" class="footnote-backref" role="doc-backlink">&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;</a></p>
</li>
<li id="fn:2" role="doc-endnote">
<p>&ldquo;Free as a Bird&rdquo; and &ldquo;Real Love&rdquo; were recorded as demos by Lennon before his death in 1980 and completed by the surviving Beatles in 1995 while Harrison was still alive.&#160;<a href="#fnref:2" class="footnote-backref" role="doc-backlink">&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;</a></p>
</li>
<li id="fn:3" role="doc-endnote">
<p>Of course they did since &ldquo;Free as a Bird&rdquo; and &ldquo;Real Love&rdquo; were released as Beatles songs, which I honestly was not aware of until now.&#160;<a href="#fnref:3" class="footnote-backref" role="doc-backlink">&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;</a></p>
</li>
<li id="fn:4" role="doc-endnote">
<p>This is what chaps my hide the most about this song being released. Using AI to digitally restore a vocal is even worse that using auto-tune.&#160;<a href="#fnref:4" class="footnote-backref" role="doc-backlink">&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;</a></p>

			 <p>Ahhh… Fall has finally come to Southern California. The Santa Ana’s are blowing hot, the air is full of dust &amp; pollen, and my lips are starting to chap. Time to take down the umbrellas, bring anything that’s not tied down inside, shut all the windows, and take an allergy pill.</p>

			 <p>I knew it wasn&rsquo;t going to last when I <a href="https://jimmitchell.org/2023/10/19/i-only-received.html">aliased my Mastodon username</a> to my Micro.blog ActivityPub username a few days ago.</p>
<p>Here are the top reasons why I decided to switch back&hellip;</p>
<ul>
<li>I find it easier to follow conversations in a dedicated Mastodon app on both desktop and mobile. Mona is my favorite.</li>
<li>There will be times when I have something to say, but may not want to post it to Micro.blog.</li>
<li>I have a separate WordPress blog that allows Mastodon users to connect with me. I&rsquo;d totally forgotten about that site.</li>
<li>I find connecting with Mastodon users easier on that platform.</li>
</ul>
<p>I swear, this will be the last time I do this&hellip; No really. 🤞🏻</p>

<p>My original script didn&rsquo;t have error-checking or user bailout points. ChatGPT was smart enough to add them for me, along with some other smart &ldquo;decisions&rdquo; when it came to copying out the generated password. I did have to make a few edits for correctness.</p>

			 <p>The final straw has been drawn with Twitter. Elon Musk cutting off API access to 3rd party Twitter clients without warning is a cunt move. I usually won&rsquo;t use language like that, but I call them as I see them and Elon Musk has 100% proven himself to be a cunt. Goodbye, Twitter. You could have been something used for change, but your new owner is nothing but a fucking moron.</p>

			 <p>And… I changed my mind again. I don’t use social media enough and with the choices being made at Twitter, it’s not worth having the accounts. Everything deleted as of last night. LinkedIn put in hibernation mode because I may need it again in the future.</p>

			 <p>Some time ago, I set up my Gmail account in Apple Mail to copy over messages which were not sent to my jimmitchellmedia.net account. I’m one of those guys who likes to have everything all in one place at my finger tips when I need it.<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>After copying over the messages I wanted, I completely removed the Gmail IMAP account from Mail and went about my business. Soon after, when I went searching for a specific email, I experienced the phenomenon of ghost emails in the search results.</p>
<p>These are messages that Mail once knew about, but no longer knows where they exist. The ghost emails were all from the since removed Gmail account.</p>
<p>If you’re experiencing the same problem, here’s a very simple fix to rebuild the Apple Mail envelope index.</p>
<p>First, quit Apple Mail if it’s running, then navigate your way to “~/Library/Mail/” (where “<!-- raw HTML omitted -->”<!-- raw HTML omitted --> is your home folder) in the Finder. Once you’re in the Mail folder, you’ll see a file named “Envelope Index” which keeps track of where all messages are located. Rename “Envelope Index” to “Envelope Index Backup” (We don’t want to trash the file just yet).</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Then, relaunch Apple Mail. You’ll be presented with a daunting “Message Import” dialog that looks like your email account was wiped out and you’re starting all over. Fear not. You’re simply rebuilding the Envelope Index at this point.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Click “Continue” to rebuild the index. Once it’s done, all those pesky phantom messages will be gone the next time you perform a search in Mail (Yay!). You can then go back to the “~/Library/Mail/” folder in the Finder and move the file you renamed to “Envelope Index Backup” to the Trash.</p>
<p>And there it is. Your Apple Mail Envelope index has been rebuilt. A very simple solution to a problem that has baffled some of the best Mac users.</p>
