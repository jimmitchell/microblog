I can’t remember what year or tournament it was, but we were at one of those all-weekend travel ball tournaments in Ventura, CA. It was still early in the morning and I went to the snack bar for a cup of coffee to shake the spiderwebs from my brain.</p>\n\n<p>As I remember it, a humorous thing happened between me and the snack bar person. Out of nowhere, there was Martin Mull with a witty remark about the situation right next to me in line. I immediately recognized who he was, but was too starstruck to engage with him. I mumbled some incoherent thing back to him and walked off with my coffee. He must’ve thought I was a clod. I wish I’d handled that differently.</p>\n\n<p>In hindsight, it struck me that he was exactly the same person I’d seen on TV so many times. His comedic timing was perfect for the moment. I think what threw me was that he was the one who engaged with me first. His level of fame allowed for him to just keep to himself, but he chose not to. That day, he was just another dad at the tournament with his daughter’s softball team.</p>\n\n<p>I always remember the day I sort of met him when I see an episode of some sitcom he was in. I especially enjoyed his work in Roseanne.</p>\n\n<p>In honor of his passing, I think I might watch a little <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLA406B241A9114BFA\">Fernwood 2Night</a>, tonight…</p>\n",

I&#8217;ve been using BBEdit since version 1.0, even longer than I&#8217;ve been using LaunchBar. I&#8217;d die without this app. For me, it&#8217;s worth the $30 upgrade every few years. If you&#8217;re a long-time Mac user, you know what BBEdit is and what it&#8217;s capable of.\n\n<h3 id=\"appsthatfelloffthelist\">Apps That Fell Off the List</h3>\n\nSince this is the first year of my list, I can&#8217;t really say what fell off the prior, but these are the apps I&#8217;ve found myself using less and less over the last year or two.\n\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Reeder</strong> - in favor of <a href=\"https://netnewswire.com\">NetNewsWire</a>. Both are really great apps, and I&#8217;m flopping back and forth between the two right now, but NetNewsWire is slightly edging out Reeder.</li>\n<li><strong>Google Chrome</strong> - in favor of Safari, obviously.</li>\n<li><strong>Agenda</strong> - I like the calendar integration of Agenda, but like <a href=\"https://micro.blog/canion\">@canion</a>, I&#8217;m leaning more towards <a href=\"https://obisidan.md\">Obsidian</a> for note taking as of late.</li>\n</ol>\n",

				"content_text": "<p>There’s a lot of hubbub in the news and online about the “new Beatles song” that dropped yesterday. As a life-long semi-pro musician, this headline hits a sour note with me.</p><!--more-->\n\n<p>Hah! See what I did there? Anyway, my thoughts…</p>\n\n<p>This song was one of many demos Lennon did after the band broke up. This is key. While we don’t know for sure, it’s unlikely he said to himself “<em>This would be a great Beatles song. I should ring up the lads.</em>” when composing the tune.</p>\n\n<p>Lennon’s widow “gave” the demo tapes to the remaining Beatles <em>years</em> after his tragic murder and even longer after the band had officially broke up. The tape Yoko turned over is purported to contain at least three of Lennon’s demos, not just this one song.</p>\n\n<p>Paul, George, and Ringo messed around with the recording, laying down all new tracks for the song. I’m sure they did this with the other demo songs too. But that’s all it is; they messed around with a demo of their deceased former bandmate. Lennon was not there to collaborate as a band member. Releasing a song as a “band” means all members have provided input on the final product. This fact alone makes the song <em>not</em> a Beatles song.</p>\n\n<p>Fast forward 25 years. Now we have machine learning that can digitally enhance anyone’s voice, and even reproduce a near perfect representation of vocals from unrelated sample files. This is how Lennon’s lyrics were included in the song – by digitally reproducing and enhancing something that was barely audible to begin with. Ultimately, these are not Lennon’s true vocals. They are a damn good representation of the man’s voice enhanced by computers.</p>\n\n<p>The use of AI bodes poorly for musicians who create their art. Will we start seeing demos of other bands which were never intended to see the light of day getting released by record labels as “the lost album of (band name here)”? I bet we will. We already are. As a result, the soul of recorded music is lost and it’s just become about the money for record labels.</p>\n\n<p>The list of credits for this song is long. But in the end, it’s still just a well (over?) produced John Lennon demo and not a Beatles recording. He is the only “songwriter” who I believe should be credited.</p>\n",

				"content_html": "<p>A while ago, I created an AppleScript that allows you to <a href=\"https://jimmitchell.org/applescript-to-compress-files-and-folders/\">compress files and folders</a> by simply dropping them onto the applet. One of the readers left a comment asking for a way to achieve the following tasks:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<ol>\n<li>Select a folder from Finder.</li>\n<li>Store the folder name as “x”.</li>\n<li>Compress all files and sub-folders within the folder “x”, including their paths.</li>\n<li>Rename the resulting zip file as “x.zip”.</li>\n<li>Delete all the files that were used to create the zip file.</li>\n</ol>\n</blockquote>\n<p>With the help of ChatGPT – and because I wanted to be lazy about it – I was able to come up with a solution to this challenge, which can be a great way to manage archives if that’s important to you.</p>\n<p>I must admit that ChatGPT did a decent job in generating the AppleScript, but there were some bugs that I had to fix manually. Nevertheless, it’s both scary and exciting to have a tool that can generate usable code.</p>\n<p>As always, you can run this script using <a

				"content_text": "A while ago, I created an AppleScript that allows you to [compress files and folders](https://jimmitchell.org/applescript-to-compress-files-and-folders/) by simply dropping them onto the applet. One of the readers left a comment asking for a way to achieve the following tasks:\n\n> 1.  Select a folder from Finder.\n> 2.  Store the folder name as “x”.\n> 3.  Compress all files and sub-folders within the folder “x”, including their paths.\n> 4.  Rename the resulting zip file as “x.zip”.\n> 5.  Delete all the files that were used to create the zip file.\n\nWith the help of ChatGPT – and because I wanted to be lazy about it – I was able to come up with a solution to this challenge, which can be a great way to manage archives if that’s important to you.<!--more-->\n\nI must admit that ChatGPT did a decent job in generating the AppleScript, but there were some bugs that I had to fix manually.

Then I figure out what I need to do to get life back on track.</p>\n\n<p>I accept I won’t always be able to say no when I should. The only thing I can do is learn from caving in to my ego and grow from it.</p>\n\n<p>When I’m stretched thin, these are some of the things I do to start cutting out the commitments that I should have said no to from the beginning.</p>\n\n<h3>Who's Affected?</h3>\n\n<p>I ask myself who’s affected most?</p>\n\n<p>Naturally, the person I’ll be letting down will be disappointed, but I ask myself who else has been neglected because I have so much on my plate?</p>\n\n<p>Usually it’s my family that suffers most when I allow distractions. It’s easy to forget these are the important relationships to nurture. They’re the ones that are always the closest, so it’s easy to put them on the back burner. I learn more and more when I overcommit that I should be guarding these relationships fiercely.</p>\n\n<p>Not only does my family suffer, but so does my health. I end up having so much going on that I don’t get proper sleep, exercise and I don’t eat well enough.</p>\n\n<p>In the end, I wind up feeling burnt-out on life as a whole and get cranky with everyone around me. The most important relationships have wound up paying the price because I said yes when I should have said no.</p>\n\n<h3>Can Someone Else Do It?</h3>\n\n<p>I have to let go of my ego and turn the work over to someone else who can do the job just as well as I would have, if not better.</p>\n\n<p>I remind myself I’m not the only person in the world who has the talents to tackle a particular project. In fact, there may even be someone else who’s much more qualified than I ever was. This helps to remind me it’s okay to step aside.</p>\n\n<p>It might even be good to let someone who isn’t as capable handle it. Allowing people to be challenged is usually when they grow the most.</p>\n\n<h3>Is it Important?</h3>\n\n<p>Sometimes the thing someone asked from me really isn’t as important to them as I think it is. I have to ask them how important it is that I be the one to do it for them.</p>\n\n<p>Maybe they don’t even care about it anymore, or know of someone else who can do it in my place. I’ll never know unless I ask.</p>\n\n<h3>Hold Your Ground</h3>\n\n<p>Of course, backing out of a commitment is akin to lighting a match that’ll burn a bridge. I have to be open to being the target for disappointment and hurt feelings.</p>\n\n<p>But I also have be ready to share how the commitment is affecting important areas of my life. Maybe it’s even hurting the relationship between me and this person. I share this so the friendship doesn’t take a turn for the worst.</p>\n\n<p>Most people will understand and be sympathetic to a plight if you’re stretched too thin, though some may not. Which ever the case, hold your ground. If you know you need to step down to protect yourself, do it with a clear conscience.</p>\n\n<p>In the end, it’s important to guard our relationships and health closely. Once we’ve lightened the load, we need to start working on ways to say no when our ego tells us to say yes.</p>\n",

				"content_text": "<p>Yay! It’s your first Dreamforce!</p>\n\n<p>You’re pumped to finally be part of the magic. I bet you’ve already looked at a lot of other blogs to learn how to be ready before you landed here.</p>\n\n<p>These are a few of my recommendations to make it a more memorable experience.</p><!--more-->\n\n<h3 id=\"comfortableshoes\">Comfortable Shoes</h3>\n\n<p>You want to wear comfortable shoes your feet are already used to, so don’t buy what you plan to wear a couple of days in advance. Take your old, ratty sneakers if you have to. I even recommend bringing two pair of super-comfy shoes if you can. Trust me, your feet will thank you for it. Having two pair of shoes helps reduce foot fatigue and keeps you feeling refreshed all around.</p>\n\n<p>You’ll do a lot of walking over the four or five days of Dreamforce (I logged over 40 miles last year), and your dogs are going to be really tired by the end of the first day. Keeping foot-fresh should be one of your top priorities.</p>\n\n<p>Bring extra socks and change them during the day too. It’ll help, I promise.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"crowdschaosandpandemonium\">Crowds, Chaos and Pandemonium</h3>\n\n<p>Rumor has it Salesforce reduced the number of attendees this year compared to last. Even if this is true, be ready for plenty of chaos and pandemonium. The entire Dreamforce campus will be really crowded, with most people looking at their mobile device to figure out where they’re going next, so pack your patience along with those shoes.</p>\n\n<p>Some people will be friendly and some won’t. It’s just how it is. Deciding to be one of the friendly people now will go a long way to enjoying the whole experience.</p>\n\n<p>Remember to smile at other people and maybe even strike up a conversation with a stranger or two while standing in a line. You never know who you might meet by chance.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"dontoverloadyourschedule\">Don’t Overload Your Schedule</h3>\n\n<p>My first year, I filled my schedule to the brim with all the great sessions I wanted to attend, and barely made half of them. Give yourself plenty of time to get to your next session. Remember; crowds, chaos and pandemonium, not just on the street, but in the hotels where sessions are held too.</p>\n\n<p>Twenty minutes to get from one place to another is not nearly enough time unless those sessions are in the same hotel. Give yourself the time to get there and find a prime seat.</p>\n\n<p>You should also have some empty time to just wander an area you’re interested in. The Admin, Developer or Expo halls have a lot to see. Having free time to stroll through them might open up some unexpected opportunities to learn something, or meet someone new.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"stayhydratedandwellfed\">Stay Hydrated and Well Fed</h3>\n\n<p>It’s going to be easy to skip a meal or forget to drink water. Bring high-protein or complex carb, non-sugary snacks to keep the hangries at bay. It’ll go a long way to helping you retain the patience you’ll need.</p>\n\n<p>Staying hydrated will help reduce headaches and fatigue too. There will be water stations all over the place… Use them!</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"dontcarryalaptop\">Don’t Carry a Laptop</h3>\n\n<p>Unless you absolutely have to have it with you, leave your laptop at the hotel. I carried mine with me the first year I attended and only pulled it out of my bag once. It was more of a ball and chain than it was the tool I thought it would be.</p>\n\n<p>Instead, carry an analog journal to take notes, or have a good note-taking app on your phone.</p>\n\n<p>Our team will be using <a href=\"https://quip.com\">Quip</a> to share session notes with each other this year. The app is so good it’s earned a permanent place on my phone’s home screen.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"dontbeafraidofyourheroes\">Don’t Be Afraid of Your Heroes</h3>\n\n<p>If you cross paths with someone from the community who inspires you, take the opportunity to introduce yourself to them. Naturally, be polite when doing it and respect any conversations your hero may already be involved in, but by introducing yourself, you could be opening the door to a friendship or opportunity further down the line.</p>\n\n<p>The community heroes are heroes for a reason – because they enjoy helping others learn and grow.</p>\n\n<p>I crossed paths with <a href=\"https://twitter.com/MikeGerholdt\">Mike Gerholdt</a> very much by chance my first Dreamforce and was totally star-struck. I wish I’d taken a few more minutes to chat with him than I did. Don’t have the same regret I do.</p>\n\n<p>Say hello, thank them for inspiring you and ask them a few questions you’d like to know about them. Wrap it up by asking if you can connect with them on social media.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"keepyourselfsafe\">Keep Yourself Safe</h3>\n\n<p>There are many areas of San Francisco I’d call questionable when it comes to your safety, especially after dark. Don’t walk if you don’t have to. There will be plenty of Uber and Lyft in the city. Getting yourself into a questionable circumstance could be scary at best and harmful at worst.</p>\n\n<p>Know your surroundings at all times and keep your head on a swivel.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"takelotsofpictures\">Take Lots of Pictures</h3>\n\n<p>Finally, take lots of pictures and share them with your friends and family, and on social media, using the #<a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/DF19\">DF19 hashtag</a>. Your pictures will remind you of the magic you experienced and keep you pumped through the year until you get to go to your next Dreamforce.</p>\n\n<p>Feel free to connect with me through social media in the menu above and let me know you’ll be at Dreamforce. I may not be a hero, but I do love connecting with other people who have a passion for Salesforce like I do. I might even know someone who can help you out. You never know…</p>\n\n<p>Hope to see you there!</p>\n",

				"title": "Memorable Cigarettes",
				"content_html": "<p>After nearly fifty years, I can still remember the first time I smoked a cigarette. It was early spring and my family lived on a farm in a semi-rural part of Colorado, a little north of Denver, at the foot of the Rocky Mountains.</p>\n<p>I lived there with my mother, wicked step-father (I&rsquo;m not even sure they were married, to be honest) and little half-sister. The closest kid my age lived more than five miles away, so I had no one to play with. This meant I had to find ways to keep myself entertained. Most of them ended up being things little boys are not supposed to do. Left to my own devices, it&rsquo;s a wonder I lived through all of my escapades.</p>\n<p>I was seven years old and had stolen a pack of my mom&rsquo;s Kool Menthol 100s. I had a pack of matches from somewhere (yes, I was a pyro too, but that&rsquo;s a post for another time) and thought I could smoke just like mom and wicked step-father did. After taking a pack from her carton in the refrigerator, I snuck outside and hid behind the juniper trees where I wouldn&rsquo;t be seen. I opened the pack, took the long cigarette out, put it between my lips, struck a match, lit up and took a big puff like I&rsquo;d seen the adults do.</p>\n<p>Oddly enough, I wasn&rsquo;t repulsed by the taste. In fact, I actually liked it. I still remember the menthol sensation on my tongue. It had a little bit of burn to it, but the taste wasn&rsquo;t that bad. I felt very grown up.</p>\n<p>Of course, my little boy brain didn&rsquo;t know you should inhale the smoke from a cigarette, which is probably good because I&rsquo;m sure if I had, I would have wound up puking my guts out behind the trees. Sometimes I wonder; if I had inhaled, would I have ended up picking up the habit nine years later, or would I have been turned off completely?</p>\n<p>There were other experiments with smoking through my childhood, but none really stuck. I&rsquo;d smoke here and there and eventually lose interest.</p>\n<p>Until the day I met Tracy. He had just moved into the neighborhood where my mother, step-sister and I were living (wicked step-father was long-gone now). I think he said he was from New York. He was my age but had already become a pack-a-day smoker. I vividly recall the summer evening he offered me a Marlboro Red from his hard pack box. You weren&rsquo;t cool if you smoked soft pack, you know. It had to be hard pack and it had to be Marlboro Reds.</p>\n<p>I began taking him up on his offers of free cigarettes. Before I knew it, I was smoking every day, bumming cigarettes from friends whenever I could. Then the moment I knew I was hooked came: I wanted to smoke while I was alone.</p>\n<p>My mother, being the spectacular parent she was, started buying my smokes for me, so I had a steady supply of my own stashed in the refrigerator. Her rationale was that she&rsquo;d rather I smoke openly instead of hiding it. I think she hoped I&rsquo;d come to hate the habit and give up. Well, thanks mom, that didn&rsquo;t quite work out as planned.</p>\n<p>So at the tender age of sixteen, I became a confirmed pack-a-day smoker. All the other kids my age were doing it, so why not me too? The problem was, I really liked smoking. I knew I wasn&rsquo;t going to stop. Other kids did it to be cool. I did it to feed the nicotine addiction.</p>\n<p>Twelve years went by, and then I met Pam.</p>\n<p>I still see the moment from our very first date in my mind&rsquo;s eye. We were running across a busy street in downtown Santa Monica to get to the club where we were headed to see a band. In the middle of the street, the hard pack of Marlboro Lights fell to the ground from my shirt pocket with a loud <em>plop</em> sound. I bent down and picked them up. When we got to the sidewalk on the other side, she immediately told me &ldquo;<em>I don&rsquo;t date people who smoke.</em>&rdquo;</p>\n<p>That was a punch to the face, but one I&rsquo;m glad I took. Naturally, I didn&rsquo;t light up on that date, or any other we had after that. We&rsquo;re still married 25 years later and she&rsquo;s my best friend. I made the choice to quit because of her and I&rsquo;m proud to say I haven&rsquo;t smoked a cigarette since before we were engaged.</p>\n<p>I can remember a bunch of different cigarettes I smoked through my life, but thanks to someone who is very special to me, I can&rsquo;t remember the very last one. For that, I&rsquo;m forever grateful.</p>",

I had a pack of matches from somewhere (yes, I was a pyro too, but that's a post for another time) and thought I could smoke just like mom and wicked step-father did. After taking a pack from her carton in the refrigerator, I snuck outside and hid behind the juniper trees where I wouldn't be seen. I opened the pack, took the long cigarette out, put it between my lips, struck a match, lit up and took a big puff like I'd seen the adults do.\n\nOddly enough, I wasn't repulsed by the taste. In fact, I actually liked it. I still remember the menthol sensation on my tongue. It had a little bit of burn to it, but the taste wasn't that bad. I felt very grown up.\n\nOf course, my little boy brain didn't know you should inhale the smoke from a cigarette, which is probably good because I'm sure if I had, I would have wound up puking my guts out behind the trees. Sometimes I wonder; if I had inhaled, would I have ended up picking up the habit nine years later, or would I have been turned off completely?\n\nThere were other experiments with smoking through my childhood, but none really stuck. I'd smoke here and there and eventually lose interest.\n\nUntil the day I met Tracy. He had just moved into the neighborhood where my mother, step-sister and I were living (wicked step-father was long-gone now). I think he said he was from New York. He was my age but had already become a pack-a-day smoker. I vividly recall the summer evening he offered me a Marlboro Red from his hard pack box. You weren't cool if you smoked soft pack, you know. It had to be hard pack and it had to be Marlboro Reds.\n\nI began taking him up on his offers of free cigarettes. Before I knew it, I was smoking every day, bumming cigarettes from friends whenever I could. Then the moment I knew I was hooked came: I wanted to smoke while I was alone.\n\nMy mother, being the spectacular parent she was, started buying my smokes for me, so I had a steady supply of my own stashed in the refrigerator. Her rationale was that she'd rather I smoke openly instead of hiding it. I think she hoped I'd come to hate the habit and give up. Well, thanks mom, that didn't quite work out as planned.\n\nSo at the tender age of sixteen, I became a confirmed pack-a-day smoker. All the other kids my age were doing it, so why not me too? The problem was, I really liked smoking. I knew I wasn't going to stop. Other kids did it to be cool. I did it to feed the nicotine addiction.\n\nTwelve years went by, and then I met Pam.\n\nI still see the moment from our very first date in my mind's eye. We were running across a busy street in downtown Santa Monica to get to the club where we were headed to see a band. In the middle of the street, the hard pack of Marlboro Lights fell to the ground from my shirt pocket with a loud _plop_ sound. I bent down and picked them up. When we got to the sidewalk on the other side, she immediately told me \"_I don't date people who smoke._\"\n\nThat was a punch to the face, but one I'm glad I took. Naturally, I didn't light up on that date, or any other we had after that. We're still married 25 years later and she's my best friend. I made the choice to quit because of her and I'm proud to say I haven't smoked a cigarette since before we were engaged.\n\nI can remember a bunch of different cigarettes I smoked through my life, but thanks to someone who is very special to me, I can't remember the very last one. For that, I'm forever grateful.\n",

This one is a total life (and time) saver.</li>\n    <li>\n<a href=\"https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/salesforce-change-set-ass/halgnjjpjodohklhpacagljceggiiplf\">Salesforce Change Set Assistant</a> – Why the functionality this extension adds to building change sets is not native I’ll never know, but it makes creating those change sets with hundreds of items a heck of a lot faster.</li>\n    <li>\n<a href=\"https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/salesforce-schema-builder/mhmpcpfhhfdoeiejndcmogmnlomkfdkk\">Salesforce.com Schema Builder Expander</a> – Want more room to work in schema builder when using a smaller screen? This extension hides the wasted header space so you see more on the canvas.</li>\n    <li>\n<a href=\"https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/salesforcecom-id-clipper/hfiffenhnefppjhloglpebefjlbhoeai\">Salesforce.com Id Clipper</a> – Just like the name says, clip any Id of any record you’re on, including RecoryTypeId, ProfileId, and RoleId. I use this one at least 10 times a day.</li>\n    <li>\n<a href=\"https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/columncopy/lapbbfoohlcmlbdaakldmmallcbcbpjb\">ColumnCopy</a> – I use this to build quick lists of fields from objects in order to share their API names for integrations, to make spreadsheets of elements in a change set, and anywhere else I want a copy of the html table I’m viewing. Works outside of Salesforce too.</li>\n    <li>\n<a href=\"https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/salesforcecom-quick-login/dccccilgophpadpomgajjlkkioipoojh\">Salesforce.com Quick Login As</a> – As an admin, I have to login as users all the time to help troubleshoot their issues. I love being able to do it from the menu bar instead of slogging my way into the Setup area.</li>\n    <li>\n<a href=\"https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/salesforcecom-sandbox-fav/nkfllgjejgfgcddfccnijhndhdmjkamf\">Salesforce.com Sandbox Favicon Extension</a> – I spend most of my day working in sandboxes creating new solutions. When a user calls for support, I have to jump into production to help them out. This extension prevents me from making changes in the wrong org once I’m done helping them out.</li>\n    <li>\n<a href=\"https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/salesforce1-simulator/cknbjckicenodbiaejbmkjhldffonggp\">Salesforce1 Simulator</a> – When you want to show off what Salesforce1 looks like, or troubleshoot a mobile issue, this one’s the bomb. I’ve impressed more than one C-level exec with this. There’s a <a href=\"https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/salesforce1-sandbox-simul/mgknkgnenlhghpfpdcohmgiejlcaapih\">sandbox</a> version too.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>These Chrome extensions save me at least a couple of hours a week, if not more — not to mention reducing the likelihood of a mistake, which is even more costly.</p>\n\n<p>What extensions do you use to make your Salesforce admin life better?</p>\n",

				"content_text": "<p>I passed the Salesforce ADM201 certification exam today. It’s been a five-year road to get here. From the first week I began working with Salesforce, I decided attaining certification was something I wanted to pursue.</p><!--more-->\n\n<p>Now that I’ve done it, I thought it might be good to share the things that helped me be successful with those looking to do the same.</p>\n\n<h2>Know Your Stuff</h2>\n\n<p>Your success or failure pretty much boils down to this… You’ve got to know your stuff or it’s never going to happen.</p>\n\n<p>The Salesforce ADM201 certification exam is not a walk in the park. You’ll never pass it by just reading the online help, or taking online practice tests and studying flash cards — most of which are badly outdated, or just plain wrong.</p>\n\n<p>You’re going to need to be familiar with just about every area of Salesforce and how it actually works — where and how you can do something, and where and why you can’t do something else.</p>\n\n<p>This means getting a developer org and configuring it just like you would if you were doing it for your day job or a client. Be creative in your approach. Try doing things you’ve never done. Try to break it. Enter real data and learn how it flows through the system from a Campaign to a converted Lead to a resolved Case.</p>\n\n<p>Learn it, live it, be it…</p>\n\n<p>Do everything in your power to wrap your head around the big picture of what Salesforce does and totally understand it. That’s what being a good admin is all about anyway — knowing what can or can’t be done.</p>\n\n<h2>Study With a Group</h2>\n\n<p>I can’t stress this one enough.</p>\n\n<p>My employer was kind enough to purchase a year of Premiere Plus Support in order to provide me the online courses to pursue certification, and I did all 60+ hours of both the ADM201 and DEV401 trainings. I learned a lot from it, but it wasn’t until I joined a study group that the learning really sank in.</p>\n\n<p>Collaborating with a group of your peers introduces fresh ideas, which could give you a completely different perspective about a topic. That, in turn, leads to other moments of discovery. If you’re serious about earning a certification, I suggest you find others who are as committed as you to passing your exam.</p>\n\n<p>I joined the <del datetime=\"2020-08-13T01:30:54+00:00\">Salesforce Certification Study Group</del> in the Salesforce Success Community. Deepa Patel and the others who volunteer with the group have worked hard to develop a successful curriculum with a high passing rate for those who are committed enough to make it to the end. It doesn’t cost any more than your time and effort, plus the $200 to register for your Salesforce ADM201 certification exam, which you’re going to spend anyway.</p>\n\n<p>Once you’re accepted into the private group, watch what goes on in the Chatter feed for a while, then when signups for the next round of sessions are announced, join the one that best suits your geographical region.</p>\n\n<h2>Make the Time</h2>\n\n<p>Okay. You’ve been accepted into the study group. But if you aren’t totally serious about earning your certification, you’ll never be successful. Period. You’ve got to want it to happen. If you don’t give studying the attention it needs, you can forget about passing, and may as well stop reading now.</p>\n\n<p>Make it what you think about when you’re sitting in traffic, brushing your teeth, or taking a shower. Turn off the TV for a couple hours each night and learn something new about Salesforce instead. Choose to become obsessed for a while.</p>\n\n<p>If you end up joining the certification study group, make time to do the work you’re supposed to do before the next session — every single week. Commit to the 15 weeks the group is going to require from you. Be ready to demo your work for the online sessions. Know exactly what you did, why you did it, and have a reason for it. I promise you’ll learn incredible amounts if you commit to working this way.</p>\n\n<h2>Be Real with Yourself</h2>\n\n<p>Be 100% honest with yourself. Ask yourself “Am I <em>really</em> ready to pursue certification?” If you’ve only been working with Salesforce a few months, it’s going to be a tough row to hoe, even with the help and support of a study group — who may not be too keen helping you along while studying themselves.</p>\n\n<p>Being part of a group requires commitment. People are depending on you to have ideas that could be different than theirs. Are you <em>really</em> ready to commit to a group of 6–12 people for 15 weeks, and collaborate with them? Are you <em>really</em> ready to do 5 to 8 hours of homework each week? It’s going to take serious sacrifice.</p>\n\n<p>If you’re not ready, then wait until you are. You have a better chance of succeeding if you do. By joining the study group without enough experience, chances are you’ll fall behind fast, which is going to discourage you. Don’t set yourself up to fail. Be ready.</p>\n\n<h2>Use Good Resources</h2>\n\n<p>I mentioned the online tests and flash cards earlier. Don’t rely on them at all. Salesforce adds lots of new features at each release. Flash cards and tests from the Spring ’11 release are full of misinformation now. If you rely on them to know your stuff, you might not know much at all.</p>\n\n<p>There is one good resource I’ll personally endorse, and that’s John Coppedge’s <a href=\"http://certifiedondemand.com/\">Certified On Demand</a>.</p>\n\n<p>I joined while John was developing the site, but would have no hesitation spending the $40 lifetime membership that he’s asking for now. It’s a good resource that’s kept current. The questions he’s developed are quite similar to the real test (but not actual questions, and are just a little easier).</p>\n\n<p>Consider supporting John’s efforts and buying a lifetime membership. Use Certified On Demand as a supplement to studying with the Salesforce Certification Study Group. It helped me be confident I was ready when I started doubting myself.</p>\n\n<p>The only other resource you need now is to watch the <del datetime=\"2020-08-13T01:30:54+00:00\">Dreamforce Get Started on the Certified Administrator Credential</del> workshop video. It provides solid advice for being ready, how to take the Salesforce ADM201 certification exam, and knowing what you’re walking into.</p>\n\n<h2>Taking Your Exam</h2>\n\n<p>You’ve scheduled your test, and now it’s time to go take it.</p>\n\n<p>There’s only one thing to be said… Know that you know what you know. If you’ve worked hard in the Salesforce Certification Study Group, you’re ready to pass. Walk into the exam knowing that fact.</p>\n\n<p>When you sit down to begin, take a minute to breathe and relax. Then start your exam using the techniques you learned from the workshop video. Before you know it, you’ll be waking out of the testing center as a Salesforce Certified Administrator.</p>\n",

<code>Recipient_Email__c</code> field so the user can see it.</p>\n<p>But it’s not that simple it seems. When the field had the <code>required=“true”</code> attribute set, the action would not fire because all validation is done on the client side and the page never posts back to the server — so the controller action never gets called.</p>\n<p>So after some digging and asking for help on the Salesforce discussion boards, the solution was to make the <code>Recipient_Email__c</code> appear as if it’s required on the page (though it’s really not), and add a new save method to my controller to handle field validation on the server side when the record gets saved.</p>\n<h2

That seemed simple enough, but it wasn’t. This is my solution for making a field appear required on a Visualforce page.\n\n![Auto-generated description: A digital form for editing a gift card order displays various fields such as customer details, order number, and email information.](https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/109466/2024/916e8e3574.jpg)\n\nIn my original Visualforce page, it seemed logical that if I set the recipient email field as required, all would work as expected. However, defining the field as required prevented my custom action in my page controller from firing and entering the email address.\n\n## Original Page Controller\n\n```java\npublic class GiftCardTestController {\n    private ApexPages.StandardController std;\n    public String cEmail {get;set;}\n    public Gift_Card_Order__c gc {get;set;}\n    public GiftCardTestController(ApexPages.StandardController stdCtrl) {\n        std = stdCtrl;\n    }\n\n    //selects the email address of the related contact\n    //and inserts into recipient email field.\n    public void fillEmail() {\n        gc = (Gift_Card_Order__c)std.getRecord();\n        cEmail = [select Id, Email from Contact where Id = :gc.Contact__c].Email;\n        gc.Recipient_Email__c = cEmail;\n    }\n}\n```\n\n## Original Visualforce Page\n\n```html\n<apex:page standardController=\"Gift_Card_Order__c\" extensions=\"GiftCardTestController\" title=\"Gift Card Test\">\n\t<apex:form>\n\t\t<apex:pageblock title=\"Gift Card\" mode=\"edit\">\n\t\t\t<apex:pageblockbuttons location=\"top\">\n\t\t\t\t<apex:commandbutton action=\"{!save}\" value=\"Save\"></apex:commandbutton>\n\t\t\t\t<<apex:commandbutton action=\"{!cancel}\" value=\"Cancel\"></apex:commandbutton>\n\t\t\t\t<apex:commandbutton action=\"{!fillEmail}\" value=\"Fill Email\"></apex:commandbutton>\n\t\t\t</apex:pageblockbuttons>\n\t\t\t<apex:pageblocksection title=\"Email Info\" columns=\"1\">\n\t\t\t\t<apex:inputfield value=\"{!Gift_Card_Order__c.Contact__c}\"></apex:inputfield>\n\t\t\t\t<apex:inputfield value=\"{!Gift_Card_Order__c.Recipient_Email__c}\" required=\"true\"></apex:inputfield>\n\t\t\t</apex:pageblocksection>\n\t\t</apex:pageblock>\n\t</apex:form>\n</apex:page>\n```\n\nIn this example, the `fillEmail()` action should select the related contact email address, and put the value in the `Recipient_Email__c` field so the user can see it.\n\nBut it’s not that simple it seems. When the field had the `required=“true”` attribute set, the action would not fire because all validation is done on the client side and the page never posts back to the server — so the controller action never gets called.\n\nSo after some digging and asking for help on the Salesforce discussion boards, the solution was to make the `Recipient_Email__c` appear as if it’s required on the page (though it’s really not), and add a new save method to my controller to handle field validation on the server side when the record gets saved.\n\n## New Page Controller\n\n```java\npublic class GiftCardTestController {\n    private ApexPages.StandardController std;\n    public String cEmail {get;set;}\n    public Gift_Card_Order__c gc {get;set;}\n    public GiftCardTestController(ApexPages.StandardController stdCtrl) {\n        std = stdCtrl;\n    }\n\n    public void fillEmail() {\n        gc = (Gift_Card_Order__c)std.getRecord();\n        cEmail = [select Id, Email from Contact where Id = :gc.Contact__c].Email;\n        gc.Recipient_Email__c = cEmail;\n    }\n\n    // add custom save method...\n    public pageReference save() {\n        gc = (Gift_Card_Order__c)std.getRecord();\n\n        // if the recipient email is null, add an error to the field\n        // and return null to remain on the current page...\n        if(gc.Recipient_Email__c == null) {\n            gc.Recipient_Email__c.addError('A valid email address is required.');\n            return null;\n        }\n\n        // otherwise, the field is filled, so it's okay to redirect to view page.\n        // standard field validation will check for valid email format.\n        else {\n            return std.save();\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\n## New Visualforce Page\n\n```html\n<apex:page standardController=\"Gift_Card_Order__c\" extensions=\"GiftCardTestController\" title=\"Gift Card Test\">\n    <apex:form>\n        <apex:pageblock title=\"Gift Card\" mode=\"edit\">\n            <apex:pageblockbuttons location=\"top\">\n                <apex:commandbutton action=\"{!save}\" value=\"Save\"></apex:commandbutton>\n                <apex:commandbutton action=\"{!cancel}\" value=\"Cancel\"></apex:commandbutton>\n                <apex:commandbutton action=\"{!fillEmail}\" value=\"Fill Email\"></apex:commandbutton>\n            </apex:pageblockbuttons>\n            <apex:pageblocksection title=\"Email Information\" columns=\"1\">\n                <apex:inputfield value=\"{!Gift_Card_Order__c.Contact__c}\"></apex:inputfield>\n\n                <!-- Updated pageBlockSectionItem -->\n                <apex:pageblocksectionitem>\n                    <apex:outputlabel>Email Recipient</apex:outputlabel>\n                    <apex:outputpanel layout=\"block\" styleClass=\"requiredInput\">\n                        <apex:outputpanel layout=\"block\" styleClass=\"requiredBlock\"></apex:outputpanel>\n                        <apex:inputfield value=\"{!Gift_Card_Order__c.Recipient_Email__c}\"></apex:inputfield>\n                    </apex:outputpanel>\n                </apex:pageblocksectionitem>\n                <!--// end pageBlockSectionItem -->\n\n            </apex:pageblocksection>\n        </apex:pageblock>\n    </apex:form>\n</apex:page>\n```\n\nNotice the `<apex:pageblocksectionitem />` code to replace the original field. This is how we make the field appear with the “required” bar. A nifty trick that took some digging to discover. Hopefully, this post saves someone else the time it took me to figure it out — and me the time when I forget it.\n\nFor convenience, here’s a [Github Gist](https://gist.github.com/jimmitchell/4595878) with field label & inline help that shows exactly how to make a field appear required on a Visualforce page.\n",
