				"content_text": "<p>Remember the late 90s and early 2000s when personal blogs were <em>the</em> thing? Everybody had one and they were like online journals; authentic, raw, and an outlet for personal thoughts, ideas, and sometimes questionable opinions.</p><!--more-->\n\n<p>It kind of feels like those days are behind us, buried under the avalanche of social media. But are they really?</p>\n\n<h3>Social Media and the Decline of the Blog</h3>\n\n<p>It didn‚Äôt happen overnight. Personal blogs didn‚Äôt just disappear in one big poof. It was more like a slow fade. As Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter took off, people ‚Äì me included ‚Äì found it easier to share bite-sized pieces of life. Why write a long, reflective post to publish on your personal site when you could sum it up in a quick status update that some ‚Äúfriend‚Äù you don‚Äôt really even know could give you a mindless like?</p>\n\n<p>Therein lies the rub. Social media is all about convenience ‚Äì fast, visual, and designed for quick consumption ‚Äì like fast food for the mind. Scroll, like, move on. Blogs, on the other hand, ask for your time and thought. They‚Äôre like the home-cooked meals we don‚Äôt have time for anymore.</p>\n\n<h3>Loss of Depth</h3>\n\n<p>Blogs were once a place for people to dive deep into ideas, emotions, and experiences. It wasn‚Äôt about only broadcasting the best parts of your life, but reflecting on the messiness, struggles, and painful lessons. You could get to know someone through their writing ‚Äì see how they think, feel, and evolve over time.</p>\n\n<p>Social media, on the other hand, with its character limits and algorithms pushing sensational, click-worthy content, doesn‚Äôt offer the same depth. Everything is a sizzle reel. You can still share long posts or threads, but how often do people really read them? We‚Äôve learned to skim content, always hungry for the next hit of dopamine from a new notification or like.</p>\n\n<h3>Why Blogs Mattered‚Ä¶ And Still Do</h3>\n\n<p>There‚Äôs something about the personal blog that social media can‚Äôt replace. It‚Äôs not just about the writing. It‚Äôs about ownership. On a blog, you control the narrative. There‚Äôs no algorithm deciding whether a post will be seen or buried. Your thoughts are out there for whoever chooses to engage with them, free from the noise of sponsored or promoted posts and trending hashtags.</p>\n\n<p>While social media offers instant gratification ‚Äì likes, short comments, shares ‚Äì a blog provides something deeper: connection. Real connection, with people who take the time to engage with your words because they want to, not because a platform nudged them into it.</p>\n\n<h3>The Shift to Niche and Professional Blogging</h3>\n\n<p>Blogs were never really dead, but they‚Äôve changed a lot since the early days. A good personal blog is hard to find now. Instead, we see more niche or professional blogs, where people share expert advice, reviews, or tutorials. These are useful, but often lack a personal touch that made blogging feel intimate back in the day.</p>\n\n<p>Many of those people have turned their personal blogs into a business, focusing on SEO and monetization rather than genuine self-expression. While there‚Äôs nothing wrong with making money, it‚Äôs a far cry from the humble beginnings of blogging as a space for pure, unfiltered thoughts.</p>\n\n<p>To be clear; you will never see an ad on my blog. This space is purely for my rumination ‚Äì be it good or bad ‚Äì and interactions with those who read.</p>\n\n<h3>Can Personal Blogging Make a Comeback?</h3>\n\n<p>Maybe. There‚Äôs a growing disdain against the superficiality of social media. People are beginning to tire of the endless scrolling, filtered versions of someone else‚Äôs perfect life, and the pressure to perform. People are coming back around to authenticity and real conversations. There‚Äôs no better place for that than a personal blog.</p>\n\n<p>For those of us who still love the art of long-form writing, and who crave meaningful connections over mindless scrolling, personal blogs offer a haven. My site may not get the instant attention or the engagement of a social post, but that‚Äôs the point ‚Äì it‚Äôs meant for something deeper.</p>\n\n<p>Is social media the death of the personal blog? Not quite. It may have nearly killed it, yes. But for those of us willing to carve out our own space in the digital landscape, personal blogs still have a heartbeat. It just takes more effort to keep it alive.</p>\n\n<p>What do you think? Is blogging a lost art, or is there hope for a revival? Start (or join) the conversation in the comments below. Or write about it on your own blog if you still have one and link back to this post. My site will automatically link back to yours ‚Äì just like in the old days.</p>\n\n<p>It‚Äôs time to get meaningful conversations happening again. Personal blogs are the perfect place for it.</p>\n",

I can‚Äôt remember what year or tournament it was, but we were at one of those all-weekend travel ball tournaments in Ventura, CA. It was still early in the morning and I went to the snack bar for a cup of coffee to shake the spiderwebs from my brain.</p>\n\n<p>As I remember it, a humorous thing happened between me and the snack bar person. Out of nowhere, there was Martin Mull with a witty remark about the situation right next to me in line. I immediately recognized who he was, but was too starstruck to engage with him. I mumbled some incoherent thing back to him and walked off with my coffee. He must‚Äôve thought I was a clod. I wish I‚Äôd handled that differently.</p>\n\n<p>In hindsight, it struck me that he was exactly the same person I‚Äôd seen on TV so many times. His comedic timing was perfect for the moment. I think what threw me was that he was the one who engaged with me first. His level of fame allowed for him to just keep to himself, but he chose not to. That day, he was just another dad at the tournament with his daughter‚Äôs softball team.</p>\n\n<p>I always remember the day I sort of met him when I see an episode of some sitcom he was in. I especially enjoyed his work in Roseanne.</p>\n\n<p>In honor of his passing, I think I might watch a little <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLA406B241A9114BFA\">Fernwood 2Night</a>, tonight‚Ä¶</p>\n",

I should ring up the lads.</em>‚Äù when composing the tune.</p>\n\n<p>Lennon‚Äôs widow ‚Äúgave‚Äù the demo tapes to the remaining Beatles <em>years</em> after his tragic murder and even longer after the band had officially broke up. The tape Yoko turned over is purported to contain at least three of Lennon‚Äôs demos, not just this one song.</p>\n\n<p>Paul, George, and Ringo messed around with the recording, laying down all new tracks for the song. I‚Äôm sure they did this with the other demo songs too. But that‚Äôs all it is; they messed around with a demo of their deceased former bandmate. Lennon was not there to collaborate as a band member. Releasing a song as a ‚Äúband‚Äù means all members have provided input on the final product. This fact alone makes the song <em>not</em> a Beatles song.</p>\n\n<p>Fast forward 25 years. Now we have machine learning that can digitally enhance anyone‚Äôs voice, and even reproduce a near perfect representation of vocals from unrelated sample files. This is how Lennon‚Äôs lyrics were included in the song ‚Äì by digitally reproducing and enhancing something that was barely audible to begin with. Ultimately, these are not Lennon‚Äôs true vocals. They are a damn good representation of the man‚Äôs voice enhanced by computers.</p>\n\n<p>The use of AI bodes poorly for musicians who create their art. Will we start seeing demos of other bands which were never intended to see the light of day getting released by record labels as ‚Äúthe lost album of (band name here)‚Äù? I bet we will. We already are. As a result, the soul of recorded music is lost and it‚Äôs just become about the money for record labels.</p>\n\n<p>The list of credits for this song is long. But in the end, it‚Äôs still just a well (over?) produced John Lennon demo and not a Beatles recording. He is the only ‚Äúsongwriter‚Äù who I believe should be credited.</p>\n",

				"content_text": "<p>No matter how well-intentioned we are, sometimes we allow things to sneak into our lives under the guise of it being something important.</p><!--more-->\n\n<p>We ask ‚Äú<em>Who else can do this?</em>‚Äù Or maybe we tell ourselves ‚Äú<em>No one else is qualified enough, so I‚Äôm the one who has to do it.</em>‚Äù</p>\n\n<p>When we start thinking like this, it‚Äôs our ego calling the shots. Maybe we want to be the hero, or we worry those who needed us in the past no longer will and that we won‚Äôt be their go-to person anymore.</p>\n\n<p>Our ego persuades us take on more and more, forcing us to say yes when our heart is telling us we should be saying no. Before we know it, the commitments have piled up on us again.</p>\n\n<p>We wake up one day and realize we‚Äôve allowed so many things back into our lives that we dread getting out of bed and facing them. We‚Äôre over-committed again and can no longer see the forest for the trees in our lives.</p>\n\n<p>When this happens to me, I make a day of solitude away from distractions and reflect on how I got to this point again. Then I figure out what I need to do to get life back on track.</p>\n\n<p>I accept I won‚Äôt always be able to say no when I should. The only thing I can do is learn from caving in to my ego and grow from it.</p>\n\n<p>When I‚Äôm stretched thin, these are some of the things I do to start cutting out the commitments that I should have said no to from the beginning.</p>\n\n<h3>Who's Affected?</h3>\n\n<p>I ask myself who‚Äôs affected most?</p>\n\n<p>Naturally, the person I‚Äôll be letting down will be disappointed, but I ask myself who else has been neglected because I have so much on my plate?</p>\n\n<p>Usually it‚Äôs my family that suffers most when I allow distractions. It‚Äôs easy to forget these are the important relationships to nurture. They‚Äôre the ones that are always the closest, so it‚Äôs easy to put them on the back burner. I learn more and more when I overcommit that I should be guarding these relationships fiercely.</p>\n\n<p>Not only does my family suffer, but so does my health. I end up having so much going on that I don‚Äôt get proper sleep, exercise and I don‚Äôt eat well enough.</p>\n\n<p>In the end, I wind up feeling burnt-out on life as a whole and get cranky with everyone around me. The most important relationships have wound up paying the price because I said yes when I should have said no.</p>\n\n<h3>Can Someone Else Do It?</h3>\n\n<p>I have to let go of my ego and turn the work over to someone else who can do the job just as well as I would have, if not better.</p>\n\n<p>I remind myself I‚Äôm not the only person in the world who has the talents to tackle a particular project. In fact, there may even be someone else who‚Äôs much more qualified than I ever was. This helps to remind me it‚Äôs okay to step aside.</p>\n\n<p>It might even be good to let someone who isn‚Äôt as capable handle it. Allowing people to be challenged is usually when they grow the most.</p>\n\n<h3>Is it Important?</h3>\n\n<p>Sometimes the thing someone asked from me really isn‚Äôt as important to them as I think it is. I have to ask them how important it is that I be the one to do it for them.</p>\n\n<p>Maybe they don‚Äôt even care about it anymore, or know of someone else who can do it in my place. I‚Äôll never know unless I ask.</p>\n\n<h3>Hold Your Ground</h3>\n\n<p>Of course, backing out of a commitment is akin to lighting a match that‚Äôll burn a bridge. I have to be open to being the target for disappointment and hurt feelings.</p>\n\n<p>But I also have be ready to share how the commitment is affecting important areas of my life. Maybe it‚Äôs even hurting the relationship between me and this person. I share this so the friendship doesn‚Äôt take a turn for the worst.</p>\n\n<p>Most people will understand and be sympathetic to a plight if you‚Äôre stretched too thin, though some may not. Which ever the case, hold your ground. If you know you need to step down to protect yourself, do it with a clear conscience.</p>\n\n<p>In the end, it‚Äôs important to guard our relationships and health closely. Once we‚Äôve lightened the load, we need to start working on ways to say no when our ego tells us to say yes.</p>\n",

I bet you‚Äôve already looked at a lot of other blogs to learn how to be ready before you landed here.</p>\n\n<p>These are a few of my recommendations to make it a more memorable experience.</p><!--more-->\n\n<h3 id=\"comfortableshoes\">Comfortable Shoes</h3>\n\n<p>You want to wear comfortable shoes your feet are already used to, so don‚Äôt buy what you plan to wear a couple of days in advance. Take your old, ratty sneakers if you have to. I even recommend bringing two pair of super-comfy shoes if you can. Trust me, your feet will thank you for it. Having two pair of shoes helps reduce foot fatigue and keeps you feeling refreshed all around.</p>\n\n<p>You‚Äôll do a lot of walking over the four or five days of Dreamforce (I logged over 40 miles last year), and your dogs are going to be really tired by the end of the first day. Keeping foot-fresh should be one of your top priorities.</p>\n\n<p>Bring extra socks and change them during the day too. It‚Äôll help, I promise.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"crowdschaosandpandemonium\">Crowds, Chaos and Pandemonium</h3>\n\n<p>Rumor has it Salesforce reduced the number of attendees this year compared to last. Even if this is true, be ready for plenty of chaos and pandemonium. The entire Dreamforce campus will be really crowded, with most people looking at their mobile device to figure out where they‚Äôre going next, so pack your patience along with those shoes.</p>\n\n<p>Some people will be friendly and some won‚Äôt. It‚Äôs just how it is. Deciding to be one of the friendly people now will go a long way to enjoying the whole experience.</p>\n\n<p>Remember to smile at other people and maybe even strike up a conversation with a stranger or two while standing in a line. You never know who you might meet by chance.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"dontoverloadyourschedule\">Don‚Äôt Overload Your Schedule</h3>\n\n<p>My first year, I filled my schedule to the brim with all the great sessions I wanted to attend, and barely made half of them. Give yourself plenty of time to get to your next session. Remember; crowds, chaos and pandemonium, not just on the street, but in the hotels where sessions are held too.</p>\n\n<p>Twenty minutes to get from one place to another is not nearly enough time unless those sessions are in the same hotel. Give yourself the time to get there and find a prime seat.</p>\n\n<p>You should also have some empty time to just wander an area you‚Äôre interested in. The Admin, Developer or Expo halls have a lot to see. Having free time to stroll through them might open up some unexpected opportunities to learn something, or meet someone new.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"stayhydratedandwellfed\">Stay Hydrated and Well Fed</h3>\n\n<p>It‚Äôs going to be easy to skip a meal or forget to drink water. Bring high-protein or complex carb, non-sugary snacks to keep the hangries at bay. It‚Äôll go a long way to helping you retain the patience you‚Äôll need.</p>\n\n<p>Staying hydrated will help reduce headaches and fatigue too. There will be water stations all over the place‚Ä¶ Use them!</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"dontcarryalaptop\">Don‚Äôt Carry a Laptop</h3>\n\n<p>Unless you absolutely have to have it with you, leave your laptop at the hotel. I carried mine with me the first year I attended and only pulled it out of my bag once. It was more of a ball and chain than it was the tool I thought it would be.</p>\n\n<p>Instead, carry an analog journal to take notes, or have a good note-taking app on your phone.</p>\n\n<p>Our team will be using <a href=\"https://quip.com\">Quip</a> to share session notes with each other this year. The app is so good it‚Äôs earned a permanent place on my phone‚Äôs home screen.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"dontbeafraidofyourheroes\">Don‚Äôt Be Afraid of Your Heroes</h3>\n\n<p>If you cross paths with someone from the community who inspires you, take the opportunity to introduce yourself to them. Naturally, be polite when doing it and respect any conversations your hero may already be involved in, but by introducing yourself, you could be opening the door to a friendship or opportunity further down the line.</p>\n\n<p>The community heroes are heroes for a reason ‚Äì because they enjoy helping others learn and grow.</p>\n\n<p>I crossed paths with <a href=\"https://twitter.com/MikeGerholdt\">Mike Gerholdt</a> very much by chance my first Dreamforce and was totally star-struck. I wish I‚Äôd taken a few more minutes to chat with him than I did. Don‚Äôt have the same regret I do.</p>\n\n<p>Say hello, thank them for inspiring you and ask them a few questions you‚Äôd like to know about them. Wrap it up by asking if you can connect with them on social media.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"keepyourselfsafe\">Keep Yourself Safe</h3>\n\n<p>There are many areas of San Francisco I‚Äôd call questionable when it comes to your safety, especially after dark. Don‚Äôt walk if you don‚Äôt have to. There will be plenty of Uber and Lyft in the city.

It was early spring and my family lived on a farm in a semi-rural part of Colorado, a little north of Denver, at the foot of the Rocky Mountains.</p>\n<p>I lived there with my mother, wicked step-father (I&rsquo;m not even sure they were married, to be honest) and little half-sister. The closest kid my age lived more than five miles away, so I had no one to play with. This meant I had to find ways to keep myself entertained. Most of them ended up being things little boys are not supposed to do. Left to my own devices, it&rsquo;s a wonder I lived through all of my escapades.</p>\n<p>I was seven years old and had stolen a pack of my mom&rsquo;s Kool Menthol 100s. I had a pack of matches from somewhere (yes, I was a pyro too, but that&rsquo;s a post for another time) and thought I could smoke just like mom and wicked step-father did. After taking a pack from her carton in the refrigerator, I snuck outside and hid behind the juniper trees where I wouldn&rsquo;t be seen. I opened the pack, took the long cigarette out, put it between my lips, struck a match, lit up and took a big puff like I&rsquo;d seen the adults do.</p>\n<p>Oddly enough, I wasn&rsquo;t repulsed by the taste. In fact, I actually liked it. I still remember the menthol sensation on my tongue. It had a little bit of burn to it, but the taste wasn&rsquo;t that bad. I felt very grown up.</p>\n<p>Of course, my little boy brain didn&rsquo;t know you should inhale the smoke from a cigarette, which is probably good because I&rsquo;m sure if I had, I would have wound up puking my guts out behind the trees. Sometimes I wonder; if I had inhaled, would I have ended up picking up the habit nine years later, or would I have been turned off completely?</p>\n<p>There were other experiments with smoking through my childhood, but none really stuck. I&rsquo;d smoke here and there and eventually lose interest.</p>\n<p>Until the day I met Tracy. He had just moved into the neighborhood where my mother, step-sister and I were living (wicked step-father was long-gone now). I think he said he was from New York. He was my age but had already become a pack-a-day smoker. I vividly recall the summer evening he offered me a Marlboro Red from his hard pack box. You weren&rsquo;t cool if you smoked soft pack, you know. It had to be hard pack and it had to be Marlboro Reds.</p>\n<p>I began taking him up on his offers of free cigarettes. Before I knew it, I was smoking every day, bumming cigarettes from friends whenever I could. Then the moment I knew I was hooked came: I wanted to smoke while I was alone.</p>\n<p>My mother, being the spectacular parent she was, started buying my smokes for me, so I had a steady supply of my own stashed in the refrigerator. Her rationale was that she&rsquo;d rather I smoke openly instead of hiding it. I think she hoped I&rsquo;d come to hate the habit and give up. Well, thanks mom, that didn&rsquo;t quite work out as planned.</p>\n<p>So at the tender age of sixteen, I became a confirmed pack-a-day smoker.

When we got to the sidewalk on the other side, she immediately told me &ldquo;<em>I don&rsquo;t date people who smoke.</em>&rdquo;</p>\n<p>That was a punch to the face, but one I&rsquo;m glad I took.

				"title": "Eliminating Digital Distractions",
				"content_html": "<p>Life is so full of distractions. It seems everything is vying for our attention in one way or another these days, with most of it coming from our electronic gadgets.</p>\n<p>If you take time to look up from your phone for a few minutes, you‚Äôll find a sea of humanity with faces buried in their own device. It‚Äôs painful to watch.</p>\n<p>Personally, I‚Äôve come to a point where I‚Äôve had it with the digital distractions in my life, so this is what I‚Äôve done about it.</p>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<p>There was a time I had more than four screens of apps on my iPhone. I know many people who have far more than that. I don‚Äôt know how they manage all those screens since I could barely cope with the number I had. I‚Äôd regularly forget where an app was, which would usually be somewhere on the third screen, beyond two other screens of mostly unused apps.</p>\n<p>Though I wasn‚Äôt aware of it, I‚Äôd made a game out of shuffling apps around on my home screens, hoping to one day land on the perfect combination that made perfect sense and put the universe back in order. Honestly, I think most of the apps on my phone back then got moved around more often than they were ever used.</p>\n<p>Once this dawned on me, I decided it was time to purge. The first order of business was to get rid of the useless time-wasting ‚Äúsocial‚Äù apps. I removed them from my phone without hesitation, deciding if I want to spend time on Facebook, I‚Äôll make time specifically for it. Now, I‚Äôm lucky if I look at the site more than three or four times a month. I don‚Äôt miss Facebook and could probably go without it entirely if I decided to. I only keep it around to stay in touch with extended family and old friends. I intentionally pared my ‚Äúfriend‚Äù list down to less than 50 people that I actually know too.</p>\n<p>After nuking the useless apps, I started an experiment with the remaining by moving the ones I didn‚Äôt absolutely need to a ‚Äúfolder‚Äù on the second home screen. If I used an app more than a few times in a week, it got ‚Äúunpacked‚Äù and promoted back to the first home screen. After a month of this, I ended up with just 16 apps on my first screen ‚Äì including the four I‚Äôd left in the dock as ‚Äúmust-have‚Äù when I started.</p>\n<p>For apps that I didn‚Äôt touch after two months, I completely removed them from the phone. I know if I ever need a particular app, I can download it again ‚Äî where it will find its rightful place on the second screen with all of the other lesser-used apps.</p>\n<p>I evaluate my home screen every few weeks now to demote or remove apps if I feel they‚Äôre not serving a purpose. This has helped me stay laser-focused when I‚Äôm using my phone.</p>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<p>For the apps I keep on my phone, if I need to see a notification of some kind, I‚Äôll set it to badge only. No sounds, vibrations, banners or alerts to distract me. I‚Äôll check it on my schedule, thank you very much.</p>\n<p>This includes email ‚Äî both personal and work. I purposely decided I didn‚Äôt want up to the moment email notifications, and I‚Äôve found it quite liberating. Now, when I see a badge on an app, maybe I‚Äôll look at it, maybe I won‚Äôt. It pretty much depends on the number displayed on the badge whether I decide to act.</p>\n<p>Of course, there are exceptions to this rule, but they are few. The Phone app obviously needs notifications ‚Äî otherwise, my phone isn‚Äôt a phone. Same for goes for Messages. I communicate with my immediate family by text a lot, so I leave this notification enabled.</p>\n<p>The only other notifications I allow are OmniFocus for task management and Fantastical for calendars. I definitely need to be on time for meetings and appointments, and I must complete my tasks on time too.</p>\n<p>Finally, I turned on ‚ÄúDo Not Disturb‚Äù mode between the hours of 10pm and 6am ‚Äî which is when I go to bed, and an hour after I get up. That first hour in the morning with no distractions helps me get focused on my day ahead.</p>\n<p>If you‚Äôre a notification junkie like I was, it‚Äôs hard to get used to working this way. But if you give it some time, you‚Äôll find you‚Äôre picking your phone up a lot less and getting a lot more done during the day.</p>\n<p>Give it a try. You‚Äôll feel less tethered to your phone, I promise.</p>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<p>As a family, we‚Äôve agreed to set limits on when and where electronic devices are acceptable. Never, ever can any one of us bring a phone to the table during a meal. This rule extends to restaurant outings too. Once a meal is on the table, all gadgets go away until after the last person finishes their meal.</p>\n<p>If we‚Äôre in a family setting for the holidays or a birthday, all devices get put away in pockets and purses so we can spend time socializing face-to-face. It‚Äôs okay if a phone comes out for a photo or two, but if any family member gets caught zoning out on their phone, everyone else reminds them of the rule. It‚Äôs worked pretty well so far.</p>\n<p>These are some of the ways I‚Äôve started breaking the twitch to reach for my phone and check it. Sometimes I forget, but I find every day gets a little easier. If you‚Äôre looking to lessen your own digital distractions, give some of these a try yourself. You might find there‚Äôs a lot more going on around you than you realized.</p>",

It seems everything is vying for our attention in one way or another these days, with most of it coming from our electronic gadgets.<!--more-->\n\nIf you take time to look up from your phone for a few minutes, you‚Äôll find a sea of humanity with faces buried in their own device. It‚Äôs painful to watch.\n\nPersonally, I‚Äôve come to a point where I‚Äôve had it with the digital distractions in my life, so this is what I‚Äôve done about it.\n\n<h2>I Removed the Useless Apps from My Phone</h2>\n\nThere was a time I had more than four screens of apps on my iPhone. I know many people who have far more than that. I don‚Äôt know how they manage all those screens since I could barely cope with the number I had. I‚Äôd regularly forget where an app was, which would usually be somewhere on the third screen, beyond two other screens of mostly unused apps.\n\nThough I wasn‚Äôt aware of it, I‚Äôd made a game out of shuffling apps around on my home screens, hoping to one day land on the perfect combination that made perfect sense and put the universe back in order. Honestly, I think most of the apps on my phone back then got moved around more often than they were ever used.\n\nOnce this dawned on me, I decided it was time to purge. The first order of business was to get rid of the useless time-wasting ‚Äúsocial‚Äù apps. I removed them from my phone without hesitation, deciding if I want to spend time on Facebook, I‚Äôll make time specifically for it. Now, I‚Äôm lucky if I look at the site more than three or four times a month. I don‚Äôt miss Facebook and could probably go without it entirely if I decided to. I only keep it around to stay in touch with extended family and old friends. I intentionally pared my ‚Äúfriend‚Äù list down to less than 50 people that I actually know too.\n\nAfter nuking the useless apps, I started an experiment with the remaining by moving the ones I didn‚Äôt absolutely need to a ‚Äúfolder‚Äù on the second home screen. If I used an app more than a few times in a week, it got ‚Äúunpacked‚Äù and promoted back to the first home screen. After a month of this, I ended up with just 16 apps on my first screen ‚Äì including the four I‚Äôd left in the dock as ‚Äúmust-have‚Äù when I started.\n\nFor apps that I didn‚Äôt touch after two months, I completely removed them from the phone. I know if I ever need a particular app, I can download it again ‚Äî where it will find its rightful place on the second screen with all of the other lesser-used apps.\n\nI evaluate my home screen every few weeks now to demote or remove apps if I feel they‚Äôre not serving a purpose. This has helped me stay laser-focused when I‚Äôm using my phone.\n\n<h2>I Set All But the Most Important Apps to a Badge Notification</h2>\n\nFor the apps I keep on my phone, if I need to see a notification of some kind, I‚Äôll set it to badge only. No sounds, vibrations, banners or alerts to distract me. I‚Äôll check it on my schedule, thank you very much.\n\nThis includes email ‚Äî both personal and work. I purposely decided I didn‚Äôt want up to the moment email notifications, and I‚Äôve found it quite liberating. Now, when I see a badge on an app, maybe I‚Äôll look at it, maybe I won‚Äôt. It pretty much depends on the number displayed on the badge whether I decide to act.\n\nOf course, there are exceptions to this rule, but they are few. The Phone app obviously needs notifications ‚Äî otherwise, my phone isn‚Äôt a phone. Same for goes for Messages. I communicate with my immediate family by text a lot, so I leave this notification enabled.\n\nThe only other notifications I allow are OmniFocus for task management and Fantastical for calendars. I definitely need to be on time for meetings and appointments, and I must complete my tasks on time too.\n\nFinally, I turned on ‚ÄúDo Not Disturb‚Äù mode between the hours of 10pm and 6am ‚Äî which is when I go to bed, and an hour after I get up. That first hour in the morning with no distractions helps me get focused on my day ahead.\n\nIf you‚Äôre a notification junkie like I was, it‚Äôs hard to get used to working this way. But if you give it some time, you‚Äôll find you‚Äôre picking your phone up a lot less and getting a lot more done during the day.\n\nGive it a try. You‚Äôll feel less tethered to your phone, I promise.\n\n<h2>I Set Limits on Use</h2>\n\nAs a family, we‚Äôve agreed to set limits on when and where electronic devices are acceptable. Never, ever can any one of us bring a phone to the table during a meal. This rule extends to restaurant outings too. Once a meal is on the table, all gadgets go away until after the last person finishes their meal.\n\nIf we‚Äôre in a family setting for the holidays or a birthday, all devices get put away in pockets and purses so we can spend time socializing face-to-face. It‚Äôs okay if a phone comes out for a photo or two, but if any family member gets caught zoning out on their phone, everyone else reminds them of the rule. It‚Äôs worked pretty well so far.\n\nThese are some of the ways I‚Äôve started breaking the twitch to reach for my phone and check it. Sometimes I forget, but I find every day gets a little easier. If you‚Äôre looking to lessen your own digital distractions, give some of these a try yourself. You might find there‚Äôs a lot more going on around you than you realized.\n",

				"content_text": "<p>I passed the Salesforce ADM201 certification exam today. It‚Äôs been a five-year road to get here. From the first week I began working with Salesforce, I decided attaining certification was something I wanted to pursue.</p><!--more-->\n\n<p>Now that I‚Äôve done it, I thought it might be good to share the things that helped me be successful with those looking to do the same.</p>\n\n<h2>Know Your Stuff</h2>\n\n<p>Your success or failure pretty much boils down to this‚Ä¶ You‚Äôve got to know your stuff or it‚Äôs never going to happen.</p>\n\n<p>The Salesforce ADM201 certification exam is not a walk in the park. You‚Äôll never pass it by just reading the online help, or taking online practice tests and studying flash cards ‚Äî most of which are badly outdated, or just plain wrong.</p>\n\n<p>You‚Äôre going to need to be familiar with just about every area of Salesforce and how it actually works ‚Äî where and how you can do something, and where and why you can‚Äôt do something else.</p>\n\n<p>This means getting a developer org and configuring it just like you would if you were doing it for your day job or a client. Be creative in your approach. Try doing things you‚Äôve never done. Try to break it. Enter real data and learn how it flows through the system from a Campaign to a converted Lead to a resolved Case.</p>\n\n<p>Learn it, live it, be it‚Ä¶</p>\n\n<p>Do everything in your power to wrap your head around the big picture of what Salesforce does and totally understand it. That‚Äôs what being a good admin is all about anyway ‚Äî knowing what can or can‚Äôt be done.</p>\n\n<h2>Study With a Group</h2>\n\n<p>I can‚Äôt stress this one enough.</p>\n\n<p>My employer was kind enough to purchase a year of Premiere Plus Support in order to provide me the online courses to pursue certification, and I did all 60+ hours of both the ADM201 and DEV401 trainings. I learned a lot from it, but it wasn‚Äôt until I joined a study group that the learning really sank in.</p>\n\n<p>Collaborating with a group of your peers introduces fresh ideas, which could give you a completely different perspective about a topic. That, in turn, leads to other moments of discovery. If you‚Äôre serious about earning a certification, I suggest you find others who are as committed as you to passing your exam.</p>\n\n<p>I joined the <del datetime=\"2020-08-13T01:30:54+00:00\">Salesforce Certification Study Group</del> in the Salesforce Success Community. Deepa Patel and the others who volunteer with the group have worked hard to develop a successful curriculum with a high passing rate for those who are committed enough to make it to the end. It doesn‚Äôt cost any more than your time and effort, plus the $200 to register for your Salesforce ADM201 certification exam, which you‚Äôre going to spend anyway.</p>\n\n<p>Once you‚Äôre accepted into the private group, watch what goes on in the Chatter feed for a while, then when signups for the next round of sessions are announced, join the one that best suits your geographical region.</p>\n\n<h2>Make the Time</h2>\n\n<p>Okay. You‚Äôve been accepted into the study group. But if you aren‚Äôt totally serious about earning your certification, you‚Äôll never be successful. Period. You‚Äôve got to want it to happen. If you don‚Äôt give studying the attention it needs, you can forget about passing, and may as well stop reading now.</p>\n\n<p>Make it what you think about when you‚Äôre sitting in traffic, brushing your teeth, or taking a shower. Turn off the TV for a couple hours each night and learn something new about Salesforce instead. Choose to become obsessed for a while.</p>\n\n<p>If you end up joining the certification study group, make time to do the work you‚Äôre supposed to do before the next session ‚Äî every single week. Commit to the 15 weeks the group is going to require from you. Be ready to demo your work for the online sessions. Know exactly what you did, why you did it, and have a reason for it. I promise you‚Äôll learn incredible amounts if you commit to working this way.</p>\n\n<h2>Be Real with Yourself</h2>\n\n<p>Be 100% honest with yourself. Ask yourself ‚ÄúAm I <em>really</em> ready to pursue certification?‚Äù If you‚Äôve only been working with Salesforce a few months, it‚Äôs going to be a tough row to hoe, even with the help and support of a study group ‚Äî who may not be too keen helping you along while studying themselves.</p>\n\n<p>Being part of a group requires commitment. People are depending on you to have ideas that could be different than theirs. Are you <em>really</em> ready to commit to a group of 6‚Äì12 people for 15 weeks, and collaborate with them? Are you <em>really</em> ready to do 5 to 8 hours of homework each week? It‚Äôs going to take serious sacrifice.</p>\n\n<p>If you‚Äôre not ready, then wait until you are. You have a better chance of succeeding if you do. By joining the study group without enough experience, chances are you‚Äôll fall behind fast, which is going to discourage you. Don‚Äôt set yourself up to fail. Be ready.</p>\n\n<h2>Use Good Resources</h2>\n\n<p>I mentioned the online tests and flash cards earlier. Don‚Äôt rely on them at all. Salesforce adds lots of new features at each release. Flash cards and tests from the Spring ‚Äô11 release are full of misinformation now. If you rely on them to know your stuff, you might not know much at all.</p>\n\n<p>There is one good resource I‚Äôll personally endorse, and that‚Äôs John Coppedge‚Äôs <a href=\"http://certifiedondemand.com/\">Certified On Demand</a>.</p>\n\n<p>I joined while John was developing the site, but would have no hesitation spending the $40 lifetime membership that he‚Äôs asking for now. It‚Äôs a good resource that‚Äôs kept current. The questions he‚Äôs developed are quite similar to the real test (but not actual questions, and are just a little easier).</p>\n\n<p>Consider supporting John‚Äôs efforts and buying a lifetime membership. Use Certified On Demand as a supplement to studying with the Salesforce Certification Study Group. It helped me be confident I was ready when I started doubting myself.</p>\n\n<p>The only other resource you need now is to watch the <del datetime=\"2020-08-13T01:30:54+00:00\">Dreamforce Get Started on the Certified Administrator Credential</del> workshop video. It provides solid advice for being ready, how to take the Salesforce ADM201 certification exam, and knowing what you‚Äôre walking into.</p>\n\n<h2>Taking Your Exam</h2>\n\n<p>You‚Äôve scheduled your test, and now it‚Äôs time to go take it.</p>\n\n<p>There‚Äôs only one thing to be said‚Ä¶ Know that you know what you know. If you‚Äôve worked hard in the Salesforce Certification Study Group, you‚Äôre ready to pass. Walk into the exam knowing that fact.</p>\n\n<p>When you sit down to begin, take a minute to breathe and relax. Then start your exam using the techniques you learned from the workshop video. Before you know it, you‚Äôll be waking out of the testing center as a Salesforce Certified Administrator.</p>\n",

				"content_text": "<p>I was asked to find a solution for our field reps that would simplify the process of adding a completed task to their activities when they visited one of our retail stores.</p><!--more-->\n\n<p>We keep our retail locations in Salesforce.com as contacts under a master account, which is shared with all users using a special account sharing rule.</p>\n\n<p>The solution I came up with was a simple flow that limited users to a specific set of enterable information, pre-filling the date of the activity, and marking the task complete when the activity was committed. Literally, the only thing they needed to do was select a picklist value and enter a comment about their visit. It was exactly what we were looking for.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/109466/2024/1ca463583b.jpg\" width=\"600\" height=\"257\" alt=\"Auto-generated description: A flowchart depicts a process involving a store visit survey with paths for successful record creation and error handling.\"></p>\n\n<p>The thing I didn‚Äôt like about the flow was that when a user entered it, context kind of got lost ‚Äì meaning they started out from a contact record, but didn‚Äôt have a good visual cue about where they were once they got into the flow.</p>\n\n<p>Sure, the flow was simple, but to me it‚Äôs still poor UX not to know the context of your work at all times. So, I decided to use a Visualforce page to solve the problem:</p>\n\n<pre><code class=\"language-html\">&lt;apex:page standardController=\"Contact\"&gt;\n    &lt;apex:sectionheader title=\"Add Retail Store Visit\" subtitle=\"{!Contact.Name}\"&gt;&lt;/apex:sectionheader&gt;\n    &lt;flow:interview name=\"Retail_Store_Visit\"&gt;\n        &lt;apex:param name=\"vContact\" value=\"{!Contact.Id}\"&gt;&lt;/apex:param&gt;\n        &lt;apex:param name=\"vAccount\" value=\"{!Contact.Account.Id}\"&gt;&lt;/apex:param&gt;\n    &lt;/flow:interview&gt;\n&lt;/apex:page&gt;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>The trouble with this was that after the flow data was committed, the user would be returned to the beginning of the flow. That‚Äôs definitely not what I wanted. I needed to go back to the contact record I started from.</p>\n\n<p>So I added the <code>finishLocation</code> attribute to the <code>&lt;flow:interview /&gt;</code> component tag. It would make sense that if I passed the Contact Id, the flow should return to the Contact record:</p>\n\n<pre><code class=\"language-html\">&lt;flow:interview name=\"Retail_Store_Visit\" finishLocation=\"{!URLFOR('/' + Contact.Id)}\"&gt;\n    &lt;apex:param name=\"vContact\" value=\"{!Contact.Id}\"&gt;&lt;/apex:param&gt;\n    &lt;apex:param name=\"vAccount\" value=\"{!Contact.Account.Id}\"&gt;&lt;/apex:param&gt;\n&lt;/flow:interview&gt;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Nope. That didn‚Äôt do it. When the flow is entered, context gets lost, so Salesforce doesn‚Äôt really know where the user is anymore. Even using the <code>vContact</code> Apex parameter didn‚Äôt work.</p>\n\n<p>I searched help documentation for an answer, but it wasn‚Äôt all that helpful. I searched Communities and came up empty. Then I searched the <a href=\"http://salesforce.stackexchange.com/\">Salesforce Stack Exchange</a>, where the only solution I could find was really convoluted, and didn‚Äôt even come close to solving my problem. I was vexed.</p>\n\n<p>Taking a break to get a cup of coffee, a solution dawned on me that turned out to be pretty darned simple. All I needed was an Apex variable in the page, which I could pass to the <code>finishLocation</code> component tag once the flow was complete. Oddly enough, this method is not documented ‚Äì at least not that I could find.</p>\n\n<p>So‚Ä¶the final Visualforce page:</p>\n\n<pre><code class=\"language-html\">&lt;apex:page standardController=\"Contact\"&gt;\n    &lt;apex:variable var=\"theContact\" value=\"{!Contact.Id}\"&gt;&lt;/apex:variable&gt;\n    &lt;apex:sectionheader title=\"Add Retail Store Visit\" subtitle=\"{!Contact.Name}\"&gt;&lt;/apex:sectionheader&gt;\n    &lt;flow:interview name=\"Retail_Store_Visit\" finishLocation=\"{!URLFOR('/' &amp; theContact)}\"&gt;\n        &lt;apex:param name=\"vContact\" value=\"{!Contact.Id}\"&gt;&lt;/apex:param&gt;\n        &lt;apex:param name=\"vAccount\" value=\"{!Contact.Account.Id}\"&gt;&lt;/apex:param&gt;\n    &lt;/flow:interview&gt;\n&lt;/apex:page&gt;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Using the Apex variable, users where returned to the contact record they started from, and could see the task they just added in the activity history related list. This was exactly what I was looking for. Everyone was happy.</p>\n\n<p>If you need to return to a starting point when using flows and Visualforce pages, consider giving this solution a try.</p>\n",

That seemed simple enough, but it wasn‚Äôt. This is my solution for making a field appear required on a Visualforce page.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/109466/2024/916e8e3574.jpg\" width=\"599\" height=\"329\" alt=\"Auto-generated description: A digital form for editing a gift card order displays various fields such as customer details, order number, and email information.\"></p>\n\n<p>In my original Visualforce page, it seemed logical that if I set the recipient email field as required, all would work as expected. However, defining the field as required prevented my custom action in my page controller from firing and entering the email address.</p>\n\n<h2>Original Page Controller</h2>\n\n<pre><code class=\"language-java\">public class GiftCardTestController {\n    private ApexPages.StandardController std;\n    public String cEmail {get;set;}\n    public Gift_Card_Order__c gc {get;set;}\n    public GiftCardTestController(ApexPages.StandardController stdCtrl) {\n        std = stdCtrl;\n    }\n\n    //selects the email address of the related contact\n    //and inserts into recipient email field.\n    public void fillEmail() {\n        gc = (Gift_Card_Order__c)std.getRecord();\n        cEmail = [select Id, Email from Contact where Id = :gc.Contact__c].Email;\n        gc.Recipient_Email__c = cEmail;\n    }\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<h2>Original Visualforce Page</h2>\n\n<pre><code class=\"language-html\">&lt;apex:page standardController=\"Gift_Card_Order__c\" extensions=\"GiftCardTestController\" title=\"Gift Card Test\"&gt;\n\t&lt;apex:form&gt;\n\t\t&lt;apex:pageblock title=\"Gift Card\" mode=\"edit\"&gt;\n\t\t\t&lt;apex:pageblockbuttons location=\"top\"&gt;\n\t\t\t\t&lt;apex:commandbutton action=\"{!save}\" value=\"Save\"&gt;&lt;/apex:commandbutton&gt;\n\t\t\t\t&lt;&lt;apex:commandbutton action=\"{!cancel}\" value=\"Cancel\"&gt;&lt;/apex:commandbutton&gt;\n\t\t\t\t&lt;apex:commandbutton action=\"{!fillEmail}\" value=\"Fill Email\"&gt;&lt;/apex:commandbutton&gt;\n\t\t\t&lt;/apex:pageblockbuttons&gt;\n\t\t\t&lt;apex:pageblocksection title=\"Email Info\" columns=\"1\"&gt;\n\t\t\t\t&lt;apex:inputfield value=\"{!Gift_Card_Order__c.Contact__c}\"&gt;&lt;/apex:inputfield&gt;\n\t\t\t\t&lt;apex:inputfield value=\"{!Gift_Card_Order__c.Recipient_Email__c}\" required=\"true\"&gt;&lt;/apex:inputfield&gt;\n\t\t\t&lt;/apex:pageblocksection&gt;\n\t\t&lt;/apex:pageblock&gt;\n\t&lt;/apex:form&gt;\n&lt;/apex:page&gt;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>In this example, the <code>fillEmail()</code> action should select the related contact email address, and put the value in the <code>Recipient_Email__c</code> field so the user can see it.</p>\n\n<p>But it‚Äôs not that simple it seems. When the field had the <code>required=‚Äútrue‚Äù</code> attribute set, the action would not fire because all validation is done on the client side and the page never posts back to the server ‚Äî so the controller action never gets called.</p>\n\n<p>So after some digging and asking for help on the Salesforce discussion boards, the solution was to make the <code>Recipient_Email__c</code> appear as if it‚Äôs required on the page (though it‚Äôs really not), and add a new save method to my controller to handle field validation on the server side when the record gets saved.</p>\n\n<h2>New Page Controller</h2>\n\n<pre><code class=\"language-java\">public class GiftCardTestController {\n    private ApexPages.StandardController std;\n    public String cEmail {get;set;}\n    public Gift_Card_Order__c gc {get;set;}\n    public GiftCardTestController(ApexPages.StandardController stdCtrl) {\n        std = stdCtrl;\n    }\n\n    public void fillEmail() {\n        gc = (Gift_Card_Order__c)std.getRecord();\n        cEmail = [select Id, Email from Contact where Id = :gc.Contact__c].Email;\n        gc.Recipient_Email__c = cEmail;\n    }\n\n    // add custom save method...\n    public pageReference save() {\n        gc = (Gift_Card_Order__c)std.getRecord();\n\n        // if the recipient email is null, add an error to the field\n        // and return null to remain on the current page...\n        if(gc.Recipient_Email__c == null) {\n            gc.Recipient_Email__c.addError('A valid email address is required.');\n            return null;\n        }\n\n        // otherwise, the field is filled, so it's okay to redirect to view page.\n        // standard field validation will check for valid email format.\n        else {\n            return std.save();\n        }\n    }\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<h2>New Visualforce Page</h2>\n\n<pre><code class=\"language-html\">&lt;apex:page standardController=\"Gift_Card_Order__c\" extensions=\"GiftCardTestController\" title=\"Gift Card Test\"&gt;\n    &lt;apex:form&gt;\n        &lt;apex:pageblock title=\"Gift Card\" mode=\"edit\"&gt;\n            &lt;apex:pageblockbuttons location=\"top\"&gt;\n                &lt;apex:commandbutton action=\"{!save}\" value=\"Save\"&gt;&lt;/apex:commandbutton&gt;\n                &lt;apex:commandbutton action=\"{!cancel}\" value=\"Cancel\"&gt;&lt;/apex:commandbutton&gt;\n                &lt;apex:commandbutton action=\"{!fillEmail}\" value=\"Fill Email\"&gt;&lt;/apex:commandbutton&gt;\n            &lt;/apex:pageblockbuttons&gt;\n            &lt;apex:pageblocksection title=\"Email Information\" columns=\"1\"&gt;\n                &lt;apex:inputfield value=\"{!Gift_Card_Order__c.Contact__c}\"&gt;&lt;/apex:inputfield&gt;\n\n                &lt;!-- Updated pageBlockSectionItem --&gt;\n                &lt;apex:pageblocksectionitem&gt;\n                    &lt;apex:outputlabel&gt;Email Recipient&lt;/apex:outputlabel&gt;\n                    &lt;apex:outputpanel layout=\"block\" styleClass=\"requiredInput\"&gt;\n                        &lt;apex:outputpanel layout=\"block\" styleClass=\"requiredBlock\"&gt;&lt;/apex:outputpanel&gt;\n                        &lt;apex:inputfield value=\"{!Gift_Card_Order__c.Recipient_Email__c}\"&gt;&lt;/apex:inputfield&gt;\n                    &lt;/apex:outputpanel&gt;\n                &lt;/apex:pageblocksectionitem&gt;\n                &lt;!--// end pageBlockSectionItem --&gt;\n\n            &lt;/apex:pageblocksection&gt;\n        &lt;/apex:pageblock&gt;\n    &lt;/apex:form&gt;\n&lt;/apex:page&gt;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Notice the <code>&lt;apex:pageblocksectionitem /&gt;</code> code to replace the original field.

Hopefully, this post saves someone else the time it took me to figure it out ‚Äî and me the time when I forget it.</p>\n\n<p>For convenience, here‚Äôs a Github Gist with field label &amp; inline help that shows exactly how to make a field appear required on a Visualforce page.</p>\n\n<script src=\"https://gist.github.com/jimmitchell/4595878.js\"></script>\n",

				"content_text": "<p>Some time ago, I set up my Gmail account in Apple Mail to copy over messages which were not sent to my jimmitchell.org account. I‚Äôm one of those guys who likes to have everything all in one place at my finger tips when I need it.</p><!--more-->\n\n<p>After copying over the messages I wanted, I completely removed the Gmail IMAP account from Mail and went about my business. Soon after, when I went searching for a specific email, I experienced the phenomenon of ghost emails in the search results.</p>\n\n<p>These are messages that Mail once knew about, but no longer knows where they exist. The ghost emails were all from the since removed Gmail account.</p>\n\n<p>If you‚Äôre experiencing the same problem, here‚Äôs a very simple fix to rebuild the Apple Mail envelope index.</p>\n\n<p>First, quit Apple Mail if it‚Äôs running, then navigate your way to ‚Äú~/Library/Mail/‚Äù (where ‚Äú~‚Äù is your home folder) in the Finder. Once you‚Äôre in the Mail folder, you‚Äôll see a file named ‚ÄúEnvelope Index‚Äù which keeps track of where all messages are located. Rename ‚ÄúEnvelope Index‚Äù to ‚ÄúEnvelope Index Backup‚Äù (We don‚Äôt want to trash the file just yet).</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/109466/2024/4d96c82270.jpg\" width=\"600\" height=\"257\" alt=\"Auto-generated description: A computer file directory shows folders and files with names, modification dates, sizes, and types, including envelope index files with alerts.\"></p>\n\n<p>Then, relaunch Apple Mail. You‚Äôll be presented with a daunting ‚ÄúMessage Import‚Äù dialog that looks like your email account was wiped out and you‚Äôre starting all over. Fear not. You‚Äôre simply rebuilding the Envelope Index at this point.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/109466/2024/2de48763c1.jpg\" width=\"600\" height=\"407\" alt=\"Auto-generated description: A Mail Message Import window prompts users to continue importing messages, with options to either proceed or cancel.\"></p>\n\n<p>Click ‚ÄúContinue‚Äù to rebuild the index. Once it‚Äôs done, all those pesky phantom messages will be gone the next time you perform a search in Mail (Yay!). You can then go back to the ‚Äú~/Library/Mail/‚Äù folder in the Finder and move the file you renamed to ‚ÄúEnvelope Index Backup‚Äù to the Trash.</p>\n\n<p>And there it is. Your Apple Mail Envelope index has been rebuilt. A very simple solution to a problem that has baffled some of the best Mac users.</p>\n",
