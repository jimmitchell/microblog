If you don't want to display them, leave the setting off.\n\n### Footer Credits\n\n<img src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/109466/2024/mnml-footer-credits.webp\" width=\"600\" height=\"68\" alt=\"Auto-generated description: The text mentions hosting by Micro.blog, powered by mmm, and designed by Jim Mitchell.\" style=\"border:1px solid var(--accent-2)\">\n\nLastly, I've added a credit line to the footer of <strong>mnml</strong> to drive people to Micro.blog, the theme's Github page, or my own site.\n\nSome of you may not mind having something like this at the bottom of your site pages, and I'm grateful to those who leave it on. But some of you may hate it, so you have the option to turn it off completely. I won't be hurt if you do.\n\nFinally, if you're someone who likes and/or uses <strong>mnml</strong>, consider supporting my development efforts. Just a <a href=\"https://buymeacoffee.com/jim.mitchell/membership\">buck a month</a> from a handful of people makes all the difference in the world towards enhancements like these.\n\nEnjoy!\n\n<a href=\"mailto:hello@jimmitchell.org\">Let me know questions</a> or if you think of an enhancement I might not have.\n\n\n\n",

There are still those commitments I have to show up for, but I don't have to put 100% effort into them until the one big thing is done.\n\nThe challenge now is to figure out what that one big thing is.\n",

But, two things made me change to Safari this year. First, Chrome has become a memory hog. As I write this, for the same five tabs open, Chrome is using 235MB of memory among 45 threads, whereas Safari is only using 151MB across 10 threads.

I started out with Mona as my Mastodon client – which is a great app too – but I just find myself gravitating more and more to Ivory. I can’t put my finger on why.

I’ve been using BBEdit since version 1.0, even longer than I’ve been using LaunchBar. I’d die without this app. For me, it’s worth the $30 upgrade every few years.

Select a folder from Finder.\n> 2.  Store the folder name as “x”.\n> 3.  Compress all files and sub-folders within the folder “x”, including their paths.\n> 4.  Rename the resulting zip file as “x.zip”.\n> 5.  Delete all the files that were used to create the zip file.\n\nWith the help of ChatGPT – and because I wanted to be lazy about it – I was able to come up with a solution to this challenge, which can be a great way to manage archives if that’s important to you.\n\nI must admit that ChatGPT did a decent job in generating the AppleScript, but there were some bugs that I had to fix manually.

It was early spring and my family lived on a farm in a semi-rural part of Colorado, a little north of Denver, at the foot of the Rocky Mountains.</p>\n<p>I lived there with my mother, wicked step-father (I&rsquo;m not even sure they were married, to be honest) and little half-sister. The closest kid my age lived more than five miles away, so I had no one to play with. This meant I had to find ways to keep myself entertained. Most of them ended up being things little boys are not supposed to do. Left to my own devices, it&rsquo;s a wonder I lived through all of my escapades.</p>\n<p>I was seven years old and had stolen a pack of my mom&rsquo;s Kool Menthol 100s. I had a pack of matches from somewhere (yes, I was a pyro too, but that&rsquo;s a post for another time) and thought I could smoke just like mom and wicked step-father did. After taking a pack from her carton in the refrigerator, I snuck outside and hid behind the juniper trees where I wouldn&rsquo;t be seen. I opened the pack, took the long cigarette out, put it between my lips, struck a match, lit up and took a big puff like I&rsquo;d seen the adults do.</p>\n<p>Oddly enough, I wasn&rsquo;t repulsed by the taste. In fact, I actually liked it. I still remember the menthol sensation on my tongue. It had a little bit of burn to it, but the taste wasn&rsquo;t that bad. I felt very grown up.</p>\n<p>Of course, my little boy brain didn&rsquo;t know you should inhale the smoke from a cigarette, which is probably good because I&rsquo;m sure if I had, I would have wound up puking my guts out behind the trees. Sometimes I wonder; if I had inhaled, would I have ended up picking up the habit nine years later, or would I have been turned off completely?</p>\n<p>There were other experiments with smoking through my childhood, but none really stuck. I&rsquo;d smoke here and there and eventually lose interest.</p>\n<p>Until the day I met Tracy. He had just moved into the neighborhood where my mother, step-sister and I were living (wicked step-father was long-gone now). I think he said he was from New York. He was my age but had already become a pack-a-day smoker. I vividly recall the summer evening he offered me a Marlboro Red from his hard pack box. You weren&rsquo;t cool if you smoked soft pack, you know. It had to be hard pack and it had to be Marlboro Reds.</p>\n<p>I began taking him up on his offers of free cigarettes. Before I knew it, I was smoking every day, bumming cigarettes from friends whenever I could. Then the moment I knew I was hooked came: I wanted to smoke while I was alone.</p>\n<p>My mother, being the spectacular parent she was, started buying my smokes for me, so I had a steady supply of my own stashed in the refrigerator. Her rationale was that she&rsquo;d rather I smoke openly instead of hiding it. I think she hoped I&rsquo;d come to hate the habit and give up. Well, thanks mom, that didn&rsquo;t quite work out as planned.</p>\n<p>So at the tender age of sixteen, I became a confirmed pack-a-day smoker.

				"content_html": "<p>Life is so full of distractions. It seems everything is vying for our attention in one way or another these days, with most of it coming from our electronic gadgets.</p>\n<p>If you take time to look up from your phone for a few minutes, you’ll find a sea of humanity with faces buried in their own device. It’s painful to watch.</p>\n<p>Personally, I’ve come to a point where I’ve had it with the digital distractions in my life, so this is what I’ve done about it.</p>\n<h3 id=\"i-removed-the-useless-apps-from-my-phone\">I Removed the Useless Apps from My Phone</h3>\n<p>There was a time I had more than four screens of apps on my iPhone. I know many people who have far more than that. I don’t know how they manage all those screens since I could barely cope with the number I had. I’d regularly forget where an app was, which would usually be somewhere on the third screen, beyond two other screens of mostly unused apps.</p>\n<p>Though I wasn’t aware of it, I’d made a game out of shuffling apps around on my home screens, hoping to one day land on the perfect combination that made perfect sense and put the universe back in order. Honestly, I think most of the apps on my phone back then got moved around more often than they were ever used.</p>\n<p>Once this dawned on me, I decided it was time to purge. The first order of business was to get rid of the useless time-wasting “social” apps. I removed them from my phone without hesitation, deciding if I want to spend time on Facebook, I’ll make time specifically for it. Now, I’m lucky if I look at the site more than three or four times a month. I don’t miss Facebook and could probably go without it entirely if I decided to. I only keep it around to stay in touch with extended family and old friends. I intentionally pared my “friend” list down to less than 50 people that I actually know too.</p>\n<p>After nuking the useless apps, I started an experiment with the remaining by moving the ones I didn’t absolutely need to a “folder” on the second home screen. If I used an app more than a few times in a week, it got “unpacked” and promoted back to the first home screen. After a month of this, I ended up with just 16 apps on my first screen – including the four I’d left in the dock as “must-have” when I started.</p>\n<p>For apps that I didn’t touch after two months, I completely removed them from the phone. I know if I ever need a particular app, I can download it again — where it will find its rightful place on the second screen with all of the other lesser-used apps.</p>\n<p>I evaluate my home screen every few weeks now to demote or remove apps if I feel they’re not serving a purpose. This has helped me stay laser-focused when I’m using my phone.</p>\n<h4 id=\"i-set-all-but-the-most-important-apps-to-a-badge-notification\">I Set All But the Most Important Apps to a Badge Notification</h4>\n<p>For the apps I keep on my phone, if I need to see a notification of some kind, I’ll set it to badge only. No sounds, vibrations, banners or alerts to distract me. I’ll check it on my schedule, thank you very much.</p>\n<p>This includes email — both personal and work. I purposely decided I didn’t want up to the moment email notifications, and I’ve found it quite liberating. Now, when I see a badge on an app, maybe I’ll look at it, maybe I won’t. It pretty much depends on the number displayed on the badge whether I decide to act.</p>\n<p>Of course, there are exceptions to this rule, but they are few. The Phone app obviously needs notifications — otherwise, my phone isn’t a phone. Same for goes for Messages. I communicate with my immediate family by text a lot, so I leave this notification enabled.</p>\n<p>The only other notifications I allow are OmniFocus for task management and Fantastical for calendars. I definitely need to be on time for meetings and appointments, and I must complete my tasks on time too.</p>\n<p>Finally, I turned on “Do Not Disturb” mode between the hours of 10pm and 6am — which is when I go to bed, and an hour after I get up. That first hour in the morning with no distractions helps me get focused on my day ahead.</p>\n<p>If you’re a notification junkie like I was, it’s hard to get used to working this way. But if you give it some time, you’ll find you’re picking your phone up a lot less and getting a lot more done during the day.</p>\n<p>Give it a try. You’ll feel less tethered to your phone, I promise.</p>\n<h3 id=\"i-set-limits-on-use\">I Set Limits on Use</h3>\n<p>As a family, we’ve agreed to set limits on when and where electronic devices are acceptable. Never, ever can any one of us bring a phone to the table during a meal. This rule extends to restaurant outings too. Once a meal is on the table, all gadgets go away until after the last person finishes their meal.</p>\n<p>If we’re in a family setting for the holidays or a birthday, all devices get put away in pockets and purses so we can spend time socializing face-to-face. It’s okay if a phone comes out for a photo or two, but if any family member gets caught zoning out on their phone, everyone else reminds them of the rule. It’s worked pretty well so far.</p>\n<p>These are some of the ways I’ve started breaking the twitch to reach for my phone and check it. Sometimes I forget, but I find every day gets a little easier. If you’re looking to lessen your own digital distractions, give some of these a try yourself. You might find there’s a lot more going on around you than you realized.</p>",

After a month of this, I ended up with just 16 apps on my first screen – including the four I’d left in the dock as “must-have” when I started.\n\nFor apps that I didn’t touch after two months, I completely removed them from the phone. I know if I ever need a particular app, I can download it again — where it will find its rightful place on the second screen with all of the other lesser-used apps.\n\nI evaluate my home screen every few weeks now to demote or remove apps if I feel they’re not serving a purpose. This has helped me stay laser-focused when I’m using my phone.\n\n#### I Set All But the Most Important Apps to a Badge Notification\n\nFor the apps I keep on my phone, if I need to see a notification of some kind, I’ll set it to badge only. No sounds, vibrations, banners or alerts to distract me. I’ll check it on my schedule, thank you very much.\n\nThis includes email — both personal and work. I purposely decided I didn’t want up to the moment email notifications, and I’ve found it quite liberating. Now, when I see a badge on an app, maybe I’ll look at it, maybe I won’t. It pretty much depends on the number displayed on the badge whether I decide to act.\n\nOf course, there are exceptions to this rule, but they are few. The Phone app obviously needs notifications — otherwise, my phone isn’t a phone. Same for goes for Messages. I communicate with my immediate family by text a lot, so I leave this notification enabled.\n\nThe only other notifications I allow are OmniFocus for task management and Fantastical for calendars. I definitely need to be on time for meetings and appointments, and I must complete my tasks on time too.\n\nFinally, I turned on “Do Not Disturb” mode between the hours of 10pm and 6am — which is when I go to bed, and an hour after I get up. That first hour in the morning with no distractions helps me get focused on my day ahead.\n\nIf you’re a notification junkie like I was, it’s hard to get used to working this way. But if you give it some time, you’ll find you’re picking your phone up a lot less and getting a lot more done during the day.\n\nGive it a try. You’ll feel less tethered to your phone, I promise.\n\n### I Set Limits on Use\n\nAs a family, we’ve agreed to set limits on when and where electronic devices are acceptable. Never, ever can any one of us bring a phone to the table during a meal. This rule extends to restaurant outings too. Once a meal is on the table, all gadgets go away until after the last person finishes their meal.\n\nIf we’re in a family setting for the holidays or a birthday, all devices get put away in pockets and purses so we can spend time socializing face-to-face. It’s okay if a phone comes out for a photo or two, but if any family member gets caught zoning out on their phone, everyone else reminds them of the rule. It’s worked pretty well so far.\n\nThese are some of the ways I’ve started breaking the twitch to reach for my phone and check it. Sometimes I forget, but I find every day gets a little easier. If you’re looking to lessen your own digital distractions, give some of these a try yourself. You might find there’s a lot more going on around you than you realized.\n",

<code>Recipient_Email__c</code> field so the user can see it.</p>\n<p>But it’s not that simple it seems. When the field had the <code>required=“true”</code> attribute set, the action would not fire because all validation is done on the client side and the page never posts back to the server — so the controller action never gets called.</p>\n<p>So after some digging and asking for help on the Salesforce discussion boards, the solution was to make the <code>Recipient_Email__c</code> appear as if it’s required on the page (though it’s really not), and add a new save method to my controller to handle field validation on the server side when the record gets saved.</p>\n<h3

				"content_text": "I’ve been working on a force.com app with the requirement that a user must enter a valid email address on a Visualforce page before being able to save a record.<!--more-->\n\nBut they must also be able to insert the related contact’s email address by clicking a button instead of having to leave the edit page to go find it. That seemed simple enough, but it wasn’t. This is my solution for making a field appear required on a Visualforce page.\n\n![Auto-generated description: A digital form for editing a gift card order displays various fields such as customer details, order number, and email information.](https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/109466/2025/8e7fa0d96b.jpg)\n\nIn my original Visualforce page, it seemed logical that if I set the recipient email field as required, all would work as expected. However, defining the field as required prevented my custom action in my page controller from firing and entering the email address.\n\n### Original Page Controller\n\n```java\npublic class GiftCardTestController {\n    private ApexPages.StandardController std;\n    public String cEmail {get;set;}\n    public Gift_Card_Order__c gc {get;set;}\n    public GiftCardTestController(ApexPages.StandardController stdCtrl) {\n        std = stdCtrl;\n    }\n\n    //selects the email address of the related contact\n    //and inserts into recipient email field.\n    public void fillEmail() {\n        gc = (Gift_Card_Order__c)std.getRecord();\n        cEmail = [select Id, Email from Contact where Id = :gc.Contact__c].Email;\n        gc.Recipient_Email__c = cEmail;\n    }\n}\n```\n\n### Original Visualforce Page\n\n```html\n<apex:page standardController=\"Gift_Card_Order__c\" extensions=\"GiftCardTestController\" title=\"Gift Card Test\">\n\t<apex:form>\n\t\t<apex:pageblock title=\"Gift Card\" mode=\"edit\">\n\t\t\t<apex:pageblockbuttons location=\"top\">\n\t\t\t\t<apex:commandbutton action=\"{!save}\" value=\"Save\"></apex:commandbutton>\n\t\t\t\t<<apex:commandbutton action=\"{!cancel}\" value=\"Cancel\"></apex:commandbutton>\n\t\t\t\t<apex:commandbutton action=\"{!fillEmail}\" value=\"Fill Email\"></apex:commandbutton>\n\t\t\t</apex:pageblockbuttons>\n\t\t\t<apex:pageblocksection title=\"Email Info\" columns=\"1\">\n\t\t\t\t<apex:inputfield value=\"{!Gift_Card_Order__c.Contact__c}\"></apex:inputfield>\n\t\t\t\t<apex:inputfield value=\"{!Gift_Card_Order__c.Recipient_Email__c}\" required=\"true\"></apex:inputfield>\n\t\t\t</apex:pageblocksection>\n\t\t</apex:pageblock>\n\t</apex:form>\n</apex:page>\n```\n\nIn this example, the `fillEmail()` action should select the related contact email address, and put the value in the `Recipient_Email__c` field so the user can see it.\n\nBut it’s not that simple it seems. When the field had the `required=“true”` attribute set, the action would not fire because all validation is done on the client side and the page never posts back to the server — so the controller action never gets called.\n\nSo after some digging and asking for help on the Salesforce discussion boards, the solution was to make the `Recipient_Email__c` appear as if it’s required on the page (though it’s really not), and add a new save method to my controller to handle field validation on the server side when the record gets saved.\n\n### New Page Controller\n\n```java\npublic class GiftCardTestController {\n    private ApexPages.StandardController std;\n    public String cEmail {get;set;}\n    public Gift_Card_Order__c gc {get;set;}\n    public GiftCardTestController(ApexPages.StandardController stdCtrl) {\n        std = stdCtrl;\n    }\n\n    public void fillEmail() {\n        gc = (Gift_Card_Order__c)std.getRecord();\n        cEmail = [select Id, Email from Contact where Id = :gc.Contact__c].Email;\n        gc.Recipient_Email__c = cEmail;\n    }\n\n    // add custom save method...\n    public pageReference save() {\n        gc = (Gift_Card_Order__c)std.getRecord();\n\n        // if the recipient email is null, add an error to the field\n        // and return null to remain on the current page...\n        if(gc.Recipient_Email__c == null) {\n            gc.Recipient_Email__c.addError('A valid email address is required.');\n            return null;\n        }\n\n        // otherwise, the field is filled, so it's okay to redirect to view page.\n        // standard field validation will check for valid email format.\n        else {\n            return std.save();\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\n### New Visualforce Page\n\n```html\n<apex:page standardController=\"Gift_Card_Order__c\" extensions=\"GiftCardTestController\" title=\"Gift Card Test\">\n    <apex:form>\n        <apex:pageblock title=\"Gift Card\" mode=\"edit\">\n            <apex:pageblockbuttons location=\"top\">\n                <apex:commandbutton action=\"{!save}\" value=\"Save\"></apex:commandbutton>\n                <apex:commandbutton action=\"{!cancel}\" value=\"Cancel\"></apex:commandbutton>\n                <apex:commandbutton action=\"{!fillEmail}\" value=\"Fill Email\"></apex:commandbutton>\n            </apex:pageblockbuttons>\n            <apex:pageblocksection title=\"Email Information\" columns=\"1\">\n                <apex:inputfield value=\"{!Gift_Card_Order__c.Contact__c}\"></apex:inputfield>\n\n                <!-- Updated pageBlockSectionItem -->\n                <apex:pageblocksectionitem>\n                    <apex:outputlabel>Email Recipient</apex:outputlabel>\n                    <apex:outputpanel layout=\"block\" styleClass=\"requiredInput\">\n                        <apex:outputpanel layout=\"block\" styleClass=\"requiredBlock\"></apex:outputpanel>\n                        <apex:inputfield value=\"{!Gift_Card_Order__c.Recipient_Email__c}\"></apex:inputfield>\n                    </apex:outputpanel>\n                </apex:pageblocksectionitem>\n                <!--// end pageBlockSectionItem -->\n\n            </apex:pageblocksection>\n        </apex:pageblock>\n    </apex:form>\n</apex:page>\n```\n\nNotice the `<apex:pageblocksectionitem />` code to replace the original field. This is how we make the field appear with the “required” bar. A nifty trick that took some digging to discover. Hopefully, this post saves someone else the time it took me to figure it out — and me the time when I forget it.\n\nFor convenience, here’s a [Github Gist](https://gist.github.com/jimmitchell/4595878) with field label & inline help that shows exactly how to make a field appear required on a Visualforce page.\n",

				"content_html": "<p>Today I had the need to add a bunch of named text files to a folder in the Finder on my Mac.</p>\n<p>I found it a major pain to open BBEdit, make a new document, save it to where I wanted it, and then manually copy &amp; rename the file back in the Finder. A lot of effort just to get 7 or 8 empty files with different names.</p>\n<p>So, I threw together this little AppleScript to add empty files instead. The gist is once launched in the Finder (using <a href=\"http://www.red-sweater.com/fastscripts/\">FastScripts</a> by <a href=\"http://www.red-sweater.com/\">Red Sweater</a> naturally. Keystroke: cmd+option+shift+N), a dialog pops up that lets you enter a file title. Then the Finder creates that file in the front-most window.
