Being an indie Mac developer were some of the best years of my life.\n\nMy journey has been a series of right place, right time moments. I wouldn‚Äôt change any of them to be where I am today. I sometimes think back to that time I was so afraid to touch a keyboard at the water company. I can‚Äôt imagine a life without technology now. It‚Äôs allowed me some of my most creatively explosive growth and connections with people that mean a lot to me.\n\nI‚Äôve been blessed by my time on the internet to say the least.\n",

Thankfully [Bartender 5's](https://www.macbartender.com) menu bar styles helped with this.\n*   Having a MagSafe charger again is great. I always thought that was a brilliant design and was sad when Apple moved away from it. I'm happy to see MagSafe making a comeback. Plus it opens up an extra USB-C port.\n*   I like the smaller screen bezel. It makes the screen feel bigger than it really is.\n*   It's fast. I'm glad I got the top spec.\n*   Sadly, it's just a little too wide for my favorite Crumpler messenger bag I've had for 15+ years. I see a replacement purchase in the near future here.\n\nAll in all, after just a few hours of use, it‚Äôs a [purchase](https://www.apple.com/macbook-air/) I‚Äôm pleased with. More thoughts to come in the next week or two.\n",

It was early spring and my family lived on a farm in a semi-rural part of Colorado, a little north of Denver, at the foot of the Rocky Mountains.</p>\n<p>I lived there with my mother, wicked step-father (I&rsquo;m not even sure they were married, to be honest) and little half-sister. The closest kid my age lived more than five miles away, so I had no one to play with. This meant I had to find ways to keep myself entertained. Most of them ended up being things little boys are not supposed to do. Left to my own devices, it&rsquo;s a wonder I lived through all of my escapades.</p>\n<p>I was seven years old and had stolen a pack of my mom&rsquo;s Kool Menthol 100s. I had a pack of matches from somewhere (yes, I was a pyro too, but that&rsquo;s a post for another time) and thought I could smoke just like mom and wicked step-father did. After taking a pack from her carton in the refrigerator, I snuck outside and hid behind the juniper trees where I wouldn&rsquo;t be seen. I opened the pack, took the long cigarette out, put it between my lips, struck a match, lit up and took a big puff like I&rsquo;d seen the adults do.</p>\n<p>Oddly enough, I wasn&rsquo;t repulsed by the taste. In fact, I actually liked it. I still remember the menthol sensation on my tongue. It had a little bit of burn to it, but the taste wasn&rsquo;t that bad. I felt very grown up.</p>\n<p>Of course, my little boy brain didn&rsquo;t know you should inhale the smoke from a cigarette, which is probably good because I&rsquo;m sure if I had, I would have wound up puking my guts out behind the trees. Sometimes I wonder; if I had inhaled, would I have ended up picking up the habit nine years later, or would I have been turned off completely?</p>\n<p>There were other experiments with smoking through my childhood, but none really stuck. I&rsquo;d smoke here and there and eventually lose interest.</p>\n<p>Until the day I met Tracy. He had just moved into the neighborhood where my mother, step-sister and I were living (wicked step-father was long-gone now). I think he said he was from New York. He was my age but had already become a pack-a-day smoker. I vividly recall the summer evening he offered me a Marlboro Red from his hard pack box. You weren&rsquo;t cool if you smoked soft pack, you know. It had to be hard pack and it had to be Marlboro Reds.</p>\n<p>I began taking him up on his offers of free cigarettes. Before I knew it, I was smoking every day, bumming cigarettes from friends whenever I could. Then the moment I knew I was hooked came: I wanted to smoke while I was alone.</p>\n<p>My mother, being the spectacular parent she was, started buying my smokes for me, so I had a steady supply of my own stashed in the refrigerator. Her rationale was that she&rsquo;d rather I smoke openly instead of hiding it. I think she hoped I&rsquo;d come to hate the habit and give up. Well, thanks mom, that didn&rsquo;t quite work out as planned.</p>\n<p>So at the tender age of sixteen, I became a confirmed pack-a-day smoker. All the other kids my age were doing it, so why not me too? The problem was, I really liked smoking. I knew I wasn&rsquo;t going to stop. Other kids did it to be cool. I did it to feed the nicotine addiction.</p>\n<p>Twelve years went by, and then I met Pam.</p>\n<p>I still see the moment from our very first date in my mind&rsquo;s eye. We were running across a busy street in downtown Santa Monica to get to the club where we were headed to see a band. In the middle of the street, the hard pack of Marlboro Lights fell to the ground from my shirt pocket with a loud <em>plop</em> sound. I bent down and picked them up. When we got to the sidewalk on the other side, she immediately told me &ldquo;<em>I don&rsquo;t date people who smoke.</em>&rdquo;</p>\n<p>That was a punch to the face, but one I&rsquo;m glad I took.
