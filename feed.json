				"content_text": "Change is inevitable in today's world as technology advances, industries evolve, and societies progress. The idea of \"better means different\" has gained popularity, suggesting that to improve, one must embrace change and pursue new and unconventional approaches. While this idea may seem appealing, it is important to critically analyze both the pros and cons of this notion to better understand its implications.\n<h3>The Pros of \"Better Means Different\"</h3>\n<ol>\n \t<li><strong>Innovation and Progress</strong>: Embracing change and seeking different approaches can lead to innovation and progress. Trying new methods, technologies, and ideas can drive improvements in various aspects of life, from business and science to personal growth. For example, the introduction of smartphones revolutionized the way we communicate, work, and access information, leading to significant progress in many areas of society.</li>\n \t<li><strong>Flexibility and Adaptability</strong>: Embracing the idea that \"better means different\" encourages flexibility and adaptability. Being able to adapt to new situations and approaches is crucial for success. Embracing change can help individuals and organizations remain agile and respond effectively to shifting circumstances, enabling them to stay ahead of the curve.</li>\n \t<li><strong>Diversity and Inclusion</strong>: Embracing different perspectives and approaches can foster diversity and inclusion. When we acknowledge that \"better means different,\" we open ourselves to diverse ideas, cultures, and people. This can lead to more inclusive decision-making, problem-solving, and collaboration, ultimately resulting in better outcomes. Research has shown that diverse teams tend to be more innovative and perform better in problem-solving tasks.</li>\n</ol>\n<h3>The Cons of \"Better Means Different\"</h3>\n<ol>\n \t<li><strong>Resistance to Change</strong>: Not everyone is comfortable with change, and embracing the idea that \"better means different\" can be challenging for some. Change can be disruptive and unsettling, especially when it requires abandoning familiar methods or systems. People may resist change due to fear of the unknown, loss of control, or increased workload. This resistance can hinder progress and innovation if not addressed effectively.</li>\n \t<li><strong>Risk of Failure</strong>: Pursuing different approaches may involve taking risks, and not all risks lead to success. Trying new methods or ideas may result in failure or setbacks, which can be demoralizing and costly. Fear of failure can deter individuals or organizations from exploring different approaches, leading to a reluctance to change and a preference for familiar methods.</li>\n \t<li><strong>Disruption and Inefficiency</strong>: Constantly pursuing different approaches can lead to disruption and inefficiency. Frequent changes can disrupt established processes, systems, and relationships, resulting in confusion, frustration, and decreased productivity. Moreover, constantly changing approaches may not allow for sufficient time to evaluate and optimize the effectiveness of each approach, leading to suboptimal outcomes.</li>\n</ol>\n<h3>The Bottom Line</h3>The notion of \"better means different\" can be a double-edged sword. While embracing change and pursuing different approaches can lead to innovation, flexibility, and diversity, it may also encounter resistance, involve risks of failure, and result in disruption and inefficiency.\n\nIt's crucial to carefully consider the context, potential benefits, and drawbacks of different approaches to achieve meaningful progress. Striking a balance between stability and change is essential, and organizations and individuals must critically evaluate the implications of this notion in their pursuit of improvement.\n\nAs the saying goes, \"change for the sake of change\" may not always lead to better outcomes, and a thoughtful, strategic approach is necessary to achieve sustained success in today's ever-evolving world.\n",

				"content_text": "Are you feeling overwhelmed by life? Do you find yourself juggling multiple tasks, drowning in notifications, and feeling like there's never enough time in a day? If so, you're not alone. In today's fast-paced world, simplicity has become a luxury that many of us crave. The good news is that living a more simple life is totally achievable, and it can bring you a sense of peace, contentment, and fulfillment.\n\nTo help you simplify your life, here are some practical tips I've found are easy to fold into your daily routine:\n\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Declutter your space</strong>: Start with the physical clutter. Take a look around you and identify items that no longer serve a purpose or bring you joy. Donate, sell, or recycle them to create a more minimalist and organized environment. From my own experience, a tidy space can do wonders for your mental clarity and overall well-being.</li>\n<li><strong>Prioritize what matters</strong>: It's time to get clear on your priorities. Identify what truly matters in life and let go of the unnecessary commitments and obligations that don't align with those values. Learn to say \"no\" to things that drain your time and energy, and make room for activities and relationships that bring you joy and fulfillment.</li>\n<li><strong>Unplug and be present</strong>: In today's digital age, it's easy to get caught up in the never-ending scroll of social media, emails, and notifications. Take regular breaks from screens and be fully present in the moment. Engage in activities that allow you to be fully present, such as reading a book, going for a walk, or having a face-to-face conversation with family and friends.</li>\n<li><strong>Simplify your routines</strong>: Streamline your daily routines to minimize decision fatigue. Simplify your morning and evening routines, meal planning, and daily tasks to create more time for activities that truly matter to you. Having a simple and structured routine can help you feel more organized and focused through the day.</li>\n<li><strong>Connect with nature</strong>: Nature has a way of reminding us of the beauty and simplicity of life. Spend time in nature, whether it's taking a hike, camping, or simply sitting in a park. Disconnect from technology and allow yourself to fully immerse in the tranquility and serenity of the natural world.</li>\n<li><strong>Cultivate meaningful relationships</strong>: Invest time and energy in building deep and meaningful relationships. Focus on quality over quantity when it comes to relationships. Prioritize spending time with people who bring joy, support, and positivity to your life.</li>\n<li><strong>Practice gratitude</strong>: Shift your mindset to one of gratitude and appreciation for what you have in your life. Take time each day to reflect on the blessings and simple pleasures of life. Gratitude can help you cultivate a positive outlook and find contentment in the present moment.</li>\n<li><strong>Pursue meaningful experiences</strong>: Instead of chasing after material possessions, focus on creating meaningful experiences that enrich your life. It could be traveling to a new place, trying a new hobby, or volunteering for a cause you're passionate about. These experiences can bring lasting joy and fulfillment that material possessions often can't.</li>\n<li><strong>Reflect and reassess regularly</strong>: Living a simple life is an ongoing process. Regularly reflect on your priorities, possessions, and commitments to ensure they align with your values and bring true fulfillment. Reassess and make adjustments as needed to stay on track with your journey towards simplicity.</li>\n</ol>\n\nSimplicity looks different for everyone. It's not about following a rigid set of rules or standards, but rather about finding what works best for you and your lifestyle. Embrace the process of simplifying your life at your own pace, and don't be afraid to make adjustments along the way.\n\nLiving a more simple life isn't about depriving yourself of things, but rather about creating space for what truly matters to you. It's about living intentionally, with a focus on the present moment and the things that bring you joy and fulfillment. So, take a step back, look at your priorities, and take one simple step to start simplifying your life today. You might be surprised at how much more fulfilling and meaningful life can be when you embrace the beauty of simplicity.\n\nAre you ready to simplify your life? Start by decluttering a physical space, prioritizing your time and energy, or being present in the moment. Reflect on your values and priorities, and make conscious choices that align with them. Embrace the beauty of nature, cultivate meaningful relationships, and practice gratitude.\n\nIt's a journey, not a destination. Be patient with yourself and enjoy the process.\n",

Two popular concepts that often come up in these discussions are minimalism and essentialism.

It&rsquo;s not about strict rules or ideologies, but rather about creating a life that aligns with your true values and purpose. Embrace the journey of self-discovery and intentional living, and see how minimalism and essentialism can positively impact your life in unique and meaningful ways.</p>\n<p>So, go ahead and declutter your physical space, be intentional about what you allow into your life, and align your choices with your values and purpose.

Essentialism, on the other hand, encourages evaluating possessions based on their true value and purpose in your life, rather than simply decluttering for the sake of minimalism.</li>\n<li><strong>Focus on What Matters</strong>: Minimalism tends to focus on simplifying physical possessions and external distractions, whereas essentialism places a strong emphasis on clarifying and pursuing what truly matters to you, aligning your choices with your values and purpose.</li>\n<li><strong>Time and Energy Management</strong>: Essentialism emphasizes intentional allocation of time, energy, and attention to the essential few, while minimalism primarily focuses on possessions and decluttering physical space.</li>\n<li><strong>Mindset</strong>: Minimalism often emphasizes the \"less is more\" mindset, whereas essentialism emphasizes the discernment and pursuit of what truly matters to you.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<h3>How Minimalism Impacts Your Life</h3>\n\nMinimalism can have a positive impact on your life in various ways:\n\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Reduced clutter and distractions</strong>: Minimalism can help you declutter your physical space and reduce distractions, leading to a more organized and focused life.</li>\n<li><strong>Increased mindfulness</strong>: By being intentional about the possessions you keep and the choices you make, minimalism can help you cultivate mindfulness and present moment awareness.</li>\n<li><strong>Enhanced aesthetics</strong>: Minimalism often results in a clean and minimalist aesthetic, which can bring a sense of calm and tranquility to your living spaces.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<h3>How Essentialism Impacts Your Life</h3>\n\nEssentialism can also have a significant impact on your life:\n\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Clarity and focus</strong>: Essentialism helps you gain clarity about what truly matters to you and enables you to focus your time, energy, and attention on those essential things, leading to increased productivity and fulfillment.</li>\n<li><strong>Alignment with values and purpose</strong>: Essentialism encourages aligning your choices with your values and purpose, helping you live a more meaningful and purpose-driven life.</li>\n<li><strong>Better decision-making</strong>: Essentialism prompts you to discern and prioritize what truly matters, which can lead to better decision-making and more intentional choices in various areas of your life.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<h3>Conclusion</h3>\n\nIn a nutshell, minimalism and essentialism may seem similar, but they have distinct differences in their principles and approaches. Minimalism focuses on decluttering possessions and simplifying external spaces, while essentialism emphasizes discernment, alignment with values and purpose, and intentional allocation of resources. Both can have a positive impact on your life, such as reduced clutter, increased mindfulness, enhanced aesthetics, clarity, focus, alignment with values and purpose, and better decision-making.\n\nIncorporating elements of both minimalism and essentialism into your life can be a powerful combination. By decluttering your physical space and being intentional about what truly matters to you, you can create a more focused and meaningful life. Aligning your choices with your values and purpose can help you live a more intentional and purpose-driven life.\n\nWhether you choose to embrace minimalism and simplify your possessions or practice essentialism to align your choices with your values and purpose, it's about finding what works best for you. It's not about strict rules or ideologies, but rather about creating a life that aligns with your true values and purpose. Embrace the journey of self-discovery and intentional living, and see how minimalism and essentialism can positively impact your life in unique and meaningful ways.\n\nSo, go ahead and declutter your physical space, be intentional about what you allow into your life, and align your choices with your values and purpose. Embrace the minimalist mindset of \"less is more\" and the essentialist philosophy of pursuing what truly matters. Create a life that is focused, intentional, and meaningful - a life that is uniquely yours!\n",

It took years to get a proper diagnosis because the condition is so rare.</em>\n\n<h3>What is Meniere's Disease?</h3>\n\nAs someone who has been living with Meniere's Disease for more than a decade, I know firsthand the challenges and impact it can have on daily life. Meniere's Disease is a chronic vestibular disorder that affects the inner ear, leading to episodes of vertigo, tinnitus, hearing loss, and a feeling of fullness or pressure in the ear. These episodes can be unpredictable and disabling, making it difficult to carry out routine activities and affecting overall quality of life.\n\n<h3>The Symptoms I Experience</h3>\n\nOne of the most distressing symptoms of Meniere's Disease for me is vertigo. During a vertigo attack, I feel a spinning sensation, accompanied by severe dizziness, imbalance, and nausea -- often with vomiting. The attacks can last for hours or even days, leaving me feeling exhausted and disoriented. The hearing loss and tinnitus that accompany Meniere's Disease also add to the challenges. The hearing loss can range from mild to severe and may be temporary or permanent. The tinnitus, which is a constant ringing, buzzing, or roaring in the ear, can be bothersome and impact my concentration and sleep.\n\n<h3>What It's Like to Have Meniere's Disease</h3>\n\nLiving with Meniere's Disease can be emotionally and physically draining. The unpredictability of vertigo attacks and the impact on daily activities can lead to frustration, anxiety, and depression. The hearing loss and tinnitus can also affect communication and social interactions, leading to feelings of isolation and withdrawal. Additionally, the fear of having a vertigo attack in public or at work can create challenges in managing work responsibilities and engaging in social activities.\n\n<h3>Strategies for Dealing with Meniere's Disease</h3>\n\nOver the years, I have learned to develop strategies to cope with Meniere's Disease and manage its impact on my daily life. Here are some strategies that have helped me:\n\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Working closely with a healthcare provider</strong>: It is crucial to work closely with a healthcare provider who specializes in vestibular disorders, such as an otolaryngologist or a neurotologist. They can provide accurate diagnosis, prescribe appropriate medications, and recommend other management strategies tailored to my specific needs.</p></li>\n<li><p><strong>Making lifestyle adjustments</strong>: I have made several lifestyle adjustments to minimize triggers for vertigo attacks, such as avoiding triggers like caffeine, sodium, alcohol, and stress. Regular exercise, sufficient sleep, and a healthy diet have also helped me manage Meniere's Disease symptoms better.</p></li>\n<li><p><strong>Managing stress</strong>: Stress is a major trigger for vertigo attacks with me, so I prioritize stress management techniques such as deep breathing, meditation, and exercise. I also engage in activities that I enjoy and find relaxing, such as reading, spending time in nature, and practicing hobbies.</p></li>\n<li><p><strong>Building a support system</strong>: Having a supportive network of family, friends, and healthcare providers has been invaluable in coping with Meniere's Disease. They provide emotional support, understanding, and practical help when needed.</p></li>\n<li><p><strong>Using assistive devices</strong>: Eventually, I'll need to use assistive devices, such as hearing aids, to manage the hearing loss associated with my Meniere's Disease. These devices will help improve my communication abilities and overall quality of life.</p></li>\n</ol>\n\n<h3>Conclusion</h3>\n\n<p>I hope this glimpse into my personal experience with Meniere's Disease and the strategies I use to manage its symptoms helps you. Despite the challenges, I have found ways to cope with Meniere's Disease and maintain a fulfilling life. It requires self-care, proper medical management, and support from loved ones and healthcare providers.\n\nBy using strategies such as lifestyle adjustments, stress management, it is possible to manage the symptoms and improve overall quality of life. If you suspect that you or a loved one may have Meniere's Disease, it is important to seek medical evaluation and guidance for proper diagnosis and management. Remember that you are not alone, and there are resources available to help you cope with Meniere's Disease.\n\n<h3>References:</h3>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p>Mayo Clinic. (2021).

				"content_html": "<p>One of my earliest childhood memories still haunts me to this day. I was just a three-and-a-half-year-old boy living with my mother, stepfather, and newborn sister in an old house in the middle of the desert in Lancaster, California.

				"content_html": "<p>Almost fifty years have passed, and I can still vividly recall the first time I lit a cigarette. I was just a seven-year-old boy, living on a farm in rural Colorado with my mother, step-father (if you could call him that), and half-sister. There were no kids my age nearby to play with, so I often found myself engaging in activities that little boys should not be doing. I had stolen a pack of my mother&rsquo;s Kool Menthol 100s and a pack of matches, and I thought I could smoke just like the adults in my life.</p>\n<p>I sneaked outside and hid behind the juniper trees, feeling a sense of rebellion and curiosity. I opened the pack, took out one of the long cigarettes, put it between my lips, struck a match, and lit up, taking a puff just like I had seen the grown-ups do. To my surprise, I didn&rsquo;t find the taste repulsive. In fact, I kind of liked it. I remember the sensation of menthol on my tongue, the slight burn in my throat, and feeling strangely grown up.</p>\n<p>As I grew older, I experimented with smoking occasionally, but it never really stuck. I would smoke here and there but would eventually lose interest. That changed when I met Tracy, a boy my age who had just moved into the neighborhood. He was already a pack-a-day smoker, and one summer evening, he offered me a Marlboro Red from his hard pack box, explaining that soft packs were not cool. I started taking him up on his offers and before I knew it, I was smoking every day, even bumming cigarettes from friends whenever I could.</p>\n<p>Then came the moment I realized I was hooked: I wanted to smoke even when I was alone. My mother, in her unique parenting style, decided to buy cigarettes for me openly rather than have me hide my habit. She hoped I would come to hate smoking and quit, but that didn&rsquo;t quite go as planned. By the time I was sixteen, I was a confirmed pack-a-day smoker. It wasn&rsquo;t about being cool like other kids; it was about feeding my nicotine addiction. Twelve years passed in a blur of cigarettes, until I met Pam.</p>\n<p>I remember our first date like it was yesterday. We were running across a busy street in Santa Monica, heading to a club to see a band. In the middle of the street, my hard pack of Marlboro Lights fell from my shirt pocket with a loud thud. I quickly picked them up, but when we reached the sidewalk, Pam told me, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t date people who smoke.&rdquo; It felt like a punch to the face, but it was a wake-up call I needed.</p>\n<p>From that moment on, I didn&rsquo;t light up on any of our dates or any day after that. Pam became my best friend, and we&rsquo;ve been married for 25 years now. I made the choice to quit smoking because of her, and I&rsquo;m proud to say that I haven&rsquo;t touched a cigarette since before we were engaged.

				"content_text": "Saying no can be hard, but it's a powerful tool that can bring positive change in our lives. It's not about weakness; it's about strength, prioritization, and self-care. When we have the courage to say no, we stop spreading ourselves too thin and make more time for what truly matters. Here are some key areas where saying no can have a profound impact:\n\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Saying No to Overcommitment</strong>: It's easy to say yes to every new project or opportunity that comes our way, but it can lead to burnout and neglect of our personal priorities. By saying no to excessive commitments, we can create space for what truly matters, such as spending time with our families, pursuing our passions, and taking care of our well-being.</p></li>\n<li><p><strong>Saying No to Unhealthy Habits</strong>: We all have bad habits that hold us back from being our best selves. Whether it's emotional eating, procrastination, or wasting time on unproductive activities, saying no to these habits allows us to break free from their grip and focus on healthier behaviors that support our well-being.</p></li>\n<li><p><strong>Saying No to Distractions</strong>: We live in a world filled with distractions, from constant notifications on our devices to external demands on our time and attention. Learning to say no to these distractions allows us to stay focused, be present in the moment, and be more productive.</p></li>\n<li><p><strong>Saying No to Negative Influences</strong>: Toxic relationships, negative environments, and draining situations can weigh us down and hinder our growth. Saying no to these influences is essential for protecting our mental and emotional well-being and creating a positive environment that nurtures our growth.</p></li>\n<li><p><strong>Saying No to Procrastination</strong>: Procrastination is a common challenge that can rob us of our time and productivity. Saying no to the temptation to delay important tasks allows us to be more disciplined, focused, and effective in achieving our goals.</p></li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>Saying no takes effort and practice, but the benefits far outweigh the challenges. It empowers us to make conscious choices, prioritize what truly matters, and create a more fulfilling life. So, let's be courageous and embrace the power of saying no to unlock our full potential and live a more intentional and meaningful life.\n",

You‚Äôll never pass it by just reading the online help, or taking online practice tests and studying flash cards ‚Äî most of which are badly outdated, or just plain wrong.</p>\n<p>You‚Äôre going to need to be familiar with just about every area of Salesforce and how it actually works ‚Äî where and how you can do something, and where and why you can‚Äôt do something else.</p>\n<p>This means getting a developer org and configuring it just like you would if you were doing it for your day job or a client. Be creative in your approach. Try doing things you‚Äôve never done. Try to break it. Enter real data and learn how it flows through the system from a Campaign to a converted Lead to a resolved Case.</p>\n<p>Learn it, live it, be it‚Ä¶</p>\n<p>Do everything in your power to wrap your head around the big picture of what Salesforce does and totally understand it. That‚Äôs what being a good admin is all about anyway ‚Äî knowing what can or can‚Äôt be done.</p>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<p>I can‚Äôt stress this one enough.</p>\n<p>My employer was kind enough to purchase a year of Premiere Plus Support in order to provide me the online courses to pursue certification, and I did all 60+ hours of both the ADM201 and DEV401 trainings. I learned a lot from it, but it wasn‚Äôt until I joined a study group that the learning really sank in.</p>\n<p>Collaborating with a group of your peers introduces fresh ideas, which could give you a completely different perspective about a topic.

Deepa Patel and the others who volunteer with the group have worked hard to develop a successful curriculum with a high passing rate for those who are committed enough to make it to the end.

				"content_text": "I passed the Salesforce ADM201 certification exam today. It‚Äôs been a five-year road to get here. From the first week I began working with Salesforce, I decided attaining certification was something I wanted to pursue.</p>\n\nNow that I‚Äôve done it, I thought it might be good to share the things that helped me be successful with those looking to do the same.\n\n<h3>Know Your Stuff</h3>\n\nYour success or failure pretty much boils down to this‚Ä¶ You‚Äôve got to know your stuff or it‚Äôs never going to happen.\n\nThe Salesforce ADM201 certification exam is not a walk in the park. You‚Äôll never pass it by just reading the online help, or taking online practice tests and studying flash cards ‚Äî most of which are badly outdated, or just plain wrong.\n\nYou‚Äôre going to need to be familiar with just about every area of Salesforce and how it actually works ‚Äî where and how you can do something, and where and why you can‚Äôt do something else.\n\nThis means getting a developer org and configuring it just like you would if you were doing it for your day job or a client. Be creative in your approach. Try doing things you‚Äôve never done. Try to break it. Enter real data and learn how it flows through the system from a Campaign to a converted Lead to a resolved Case.\n\nLearn it, live it, be it‚Ä¶\n\nDo everything in your power to wrap your head around the big picture of what Salesforce does and totally understand it. That‚Äôs what being a good admin is all about anyway ‚Äî knowing what can or can‚Äôt be done.\n\n<h3>Study With a Group</h3>\n\nI can‚Äôt stress this one enough.\n\nMy employer was kind enough to purchase a year of Premiere Plus Support in order to provide me the online courses to pursue certification, and I did all 60+ hours of both the ADM201 and DEV401 trainings. I learned a lot from it, but it wasn‚Äôt until I joined a study group that the learning really sank in.\n\nCollaborating with a group of your peers introduces fresh ideas, which could give you a completely different perspective about a topic. That, in turn, leads to other moments of discovery. If you‚Äôre serious about earning a certification, I suggest you find others who are as committed as you to passing your exam.\n\nI joined the <del datetime=\"2020-08-13T01:30:54+00:00\">Salesforce Certification Study Group</del>[efn_note]Thanks to link rot, this site is no longer available.[/efn_note] in the Salesforce Success Community. Deepa Patel and the others who volunteer with the group have worked hard to develop a successful curriculum with a high passing rate for those who are committed enough to make it to the end. It doesn‚Äôt cost any more than your time and effort, plus the $200 to register for your Salesforce ADM201 certification exam, which you‚Äôre going to spend anyway.\n\nOnce you‚Äôre accepted into the private group, watch what goes on in the Chatter feed for a while, then when signups for the next round of sessions are announced, join the one that best suits your geographical region.\n\n<h3>Make the Time</h3>\n\nOkay. You‚Äôve been accepted into the study group. But if you aren‚Äôt totally serious about earning your certification, you‚Äôll never be successful. Period. You‚Äôve got to want it to happen. If you don‚Äôt give studying the attention it needs, you can forget about passing, and may as well stop reading now.\n\nMake it what you think about when you‚Äôre sitting in traffic, brushing your teeth, or taking a shower. Turn off the TV for a couple hours each night and learn something new about Salesforce instead. Choose to become obsessed for a while.\n\nIf you end up joining the certification study group, make time to do the work you‚Äôre supposed to do before the next session ‚Äî every single week. Commit to the 15 weeks the group is going to require from you. Be ready to demo your work for the online sessions. Know exactly what you did, why you did it, and have a reason for it. I promise you‚Äôll learn incredible amounts if you commit to working this way.\n\n<h3>Be Real with Yourself</h3>\n\nBe 100% honest with yourself. Ask yourself ‚ÄúAm I <em>really</em> ready to pursue certification?‚Äù If you‚Äôve only been working with Salesforce a few months, it‚Äôs going to be a tough row to hoe, even with the help and support of a study group ‚Äî who may not be too keen helping you along while studying themselves.\n\nBeing part of a group requires commitment. People are depending on you to have ideas that could be different than theirs. Are you <em>really</em> ready to commit to a group of 6&#8211;12 people for 15 weeks, and collaborate with them? Are you <em>really</em> ready to do 5 to 8 hours of homework each week? It‚Äôs going to take serious sacrifice.\n\nIf you‚Äôre not ready, then wait until you are. You have a better chance of succeeding if you do. By joining the study group without enough experience, chances are you‚Äôll fall behind fast, which is going to discourage you. Don‚Äôt set yourself up to fail. Be ready.\n\n<h3>Use Good Resources</h3>\n\nI mentioned the online tests and flash cards earlier. Don‚Äôt rely on them at all. Salesforce adds lots of new features at each release. Flash cards and tests from the Spring ‚Äô11 release are full of misinformation now. If you rely on them to know your stuff, you might not know much at all.\n\nThere is one good resource I‚Äôll personally endorse, and that‚Äôs John Coppedge‚Äôs <a href=\"http://certifiedondemand.com/\">Certified On Demand</a>.\n\nI joined while John was developing the site, but would have no hesitation spending the $40 lifetime membership that he‚Äôs asking for now. It‚Äôs a good resource that‚Äôs kept current. The questions he‚Äôs developed are quite similar to the real test (but not actual questions, and are just a little easier).\n\nConsider supporting John‚Äôs efforts and buying a lifetime membership. Use Certified On Demand as a supplement to studying with the Salesforce Certification Study Group. It helped me be confident I was ready when I started doubting myself.\n\nThe only other resource you need now is to watch the <del datetime=\"2020-08-13T01:30:54+00:00\">Dreamforce Get Started on the Certified Administrator Credential</del>[efn_note]Link rot got this one too.

It provides solid advice for being ready, how to take the Salesforce ADM201 certification exam, and knowing what you‚Äôre walking into.\n\n<h3>Taking Your Exam</h3>\n\nYou‚Äôve scheduled your test, and now it‚Äôs time to go take it.\n\nThere‚Äôs only one thing to be said‚Ä¶ Know that you know what you know. If you‚Äôve worked hard in the Salesforce Certification Study Group, you‚Äôre ready to pass. Walk into the exam knowing that fact.\n\nWhen you sit down to begin, take a minute to breathe and relax.

				"content_html": "<p>I‚Äôve been working on a force.com app with the requirement that a user must enter a valid email address on a Visualforce page before being able to save a record.</p>\n<p>But they must also be able to insert the related contact‚Äôs email address by clicking a button instead of having to leave the edit page to go find it.

When the field had the <code>required=&#8220;true&#8221;</code> attribute set, the action would not fire because all validation is done on the client side and the page never posts back to the server ‚Äî so the controller action never gets called.\n\nSo after some digging and asking for help on the Salesforce discussion boards, the solution was to make the <code>Recipient_Email__c</code> appear as if it‚Äôs required on the page (though it‚Äôs really not), and add a new save method to my controller to handle field validation on the server side when the record gets saved.\n\n<h3>New Page Controller</h3>\n\n<pre><code class=\"language-java\">public class GiftCardTestController {\n    private ApexPages.StandardController std;\n    public String cEmail {get;set;}\n    public Gift_Card_Order__c gc {get;set;}\n    public GiftCardTestController(ApexPages.StandardController stdCtrl) {\n        std = stdCtrl;\n    }\n\n    public void fillEmail() {\n        gc = (Gift_Card_Order__c)std.getRecord();\n        cEmail = [select Id, Email from Contact where Id = :gc.Contact__c].Email;\n        gc.Recipient_Email__c = cEmail;\n    }\n\n    // add custom save method...\n    public pageReference save() {\n        gc = (Gift_Card_Order__c)std.getRecord();\n\n        // if the recipient email is null, add an error to the field\n        // and return null to remain on the current page...\n        if(gc.Recipient_Email__c == null) {\n            gc.Recipient_Email__c.addError('A valid email address is required.');\n            return null;\n        }\n\n        // otherwise, the field is filled, so it's okay to redirect to view page.\n        // standard field validation will check for valid email format.\n        else {\n            return std.save();\n        }\n    }\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<h3>New Visualforce Page</h3>\n\n<pre><code class=\"language-html\">&lt;apex:page standardController=\"Gift_Card_Order__c\" extensions=\"GiftCardTestController\" title=\"Gift Card Test\"&gt;\n    &lt;apex:form&gt;\n        &lt;apex:pageblock title=\"Gift Card\" mode=\"edit\"&gt;\n            &lt;apex:pageblockbuttons location=\"top\"&gt;\n                &lt;apex:commandbutton action=\"{!save}\" value=\"Save\"&gt;&lt;/apex:commandbutton&gt;\n                &lt;apex:commandbutton action=\"{!cancel}\" value=\"Cancel\"&gt;&lt;/apex:commandbutton&gt;\n                &lt;apex:commandbutton action=\"{!fillEmail}\" value=\"Fill Email\"&gt;&lt;/apex:commandbutton&gt;\n            &lt;/apex:pageblockbuttons&gt;\n            &lt;apex:pageblocksection title=\"Email Information\" columns=\"1\"&gt;\n                &lt;apex:inputfield value=\"{!Gift_Card_Order__c.Contact__c}\"&gt;&lt;/apex:inputfield&gt;\n\n                &lt;!-- Updated pageBlockSectionItem --&gt;\n                &lt;apex:pageblocksectionitem&gt;\n                    &lt;apex:outputlabel&gt;Email Recipient&lt;/apex:outputlabel&gt;\n                    &lt;apex:outputpanel layout=\"block\" styleClass=\"requiredInput\"&gt;\n                        &lt;apex:outputpanel layout=\"block\" styleClass=\"requiredBlock\"&gt;&lt;/apex:outputpanel&gt;\n                        &lt;apex:inputfield value=\"{!Gift_Card_Order__c.Recipient_Email__c}\"&gt;&lt;/apex:inputfield&gt;\n                    &lt;/apex:outputpanel&gt;\n                &lt;/apex:pageblocksectionitem&gt;\n                &lt;!--// end pageBlockSectionItem --&gt;\n\n            &lt;/apex:pageblocksection&gt;\n        &lt;/apex:pageblock&gt;\n    &lt;/apex:form&gt;\n&lt;/apex:page&gt;\n</code></pre>\n\nNotice the <code>&lt;apex:pageblocksectionitem /&gt;</code> code to replace the original field. This is how we make the field appear with the ‚Äúrequired‚Äù bar. A nifty trick that took some digging to discover. Hopefully, this post saves someone else the time it took me to figure it out ‚Äî and me the time when I forget it.\n\nFor convenience, here‚Äôs a Github Gist with field label &amp; inline help that shows exactly how to make a field appear required on a Visualforce page.\n\n<script src=\"https://gist.github.com/jimmitchell/4595878.js\"></script>\n",
